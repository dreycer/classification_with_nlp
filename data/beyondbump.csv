0,Relationship being tested after child,"I guess it’s true when they say a child really puts your relationship to the test. My partner and I have been together for ten years (met in high school) we’ve had our fair share of ups and downs. He was so different before I got pregnant, now I feel like I don’t know this person. He’s the definition of lazy, hardly helped me when the baby was born (I struggled a lot with depression and recovering from a c section), didn’t go to work for the longest time, and now fast forward to 8 months later and nothing much has changed. He hardly spends time with our son and acts as if it’s a chore, all he wants to do is spend time outside alone smoking. I’m a SAHM but I graduated last year with my bachelors degree and decided to put my career on hold to raise our son. However, I feel like I need a change in my life I cannot continue like this, this is no life to live with my son, we are always stuck at home, struggling with money, and my partner refuses to look for another job. I’m honestly considering splitting up, I feel like I would be much happier alone. I’m just scared honestly of how I’m going to move forward with my 8 month old son, daycares scare me and there’s no one else to watch him while I work. I basically spent half my life with this person and I never wanted my son to grow up without both parents so this is a very difficult decision.",beyondthebump
1,Trick for giving baby medicine?,"Ok picking your brains here… how in the hell do you get medicine down your wee one’s throat? Every time I try and use the syringe she flails her head around, and if I do manage to get some in she either blows raspberries and it comes out again, or she swallows and a minute later does a massive vomit. I need to give her antibiotics 😢",beyondthebump
2,Wanted to send some love and encouragement,"I posted here a few weeks ago, really struggling with my mental health. I was feeling really down and feared I was suffering from postpartum depression. A few of you replied with encouraging words and shared your experiences, which really helped me feel less alone in my feelings. 

I'm almost 4 weeks PP and feeling multitudes better than I was a few weeks ago. It seems like I just had a pretty strong case of baby blues. There were a number of times where I just stared at baby boy in my arms and just cried and cried and cried. My poor husband tried to console me every day but I couldn't find the words to explain to him how I was feeling. I think I also felt ashamed because I wasn't feeling bonded to our sweet boy. I felt so defeated and devastated. 

I'm happy to report that we've had a pretty big turn around. I've got some of my energy back and I'm feeling a lot closer to baby boy. Sharing my birth story here really helped me release a lot of my feelings. I was finally able to verbalize everything to my husband too, which was super emotional but also connected us deeper in a way. We've figured out a baby care schedule that has really helped ease my anxiety and allowed me to get some rest (thank goodness he still works from home!!). I also signed up for a support group, which I think will help me even more mentally once it starts.

Anyway, I just wanted to send my love to all the mamas out there that may be struggling. I honestly didn't think there was a light at the end of the tunnel and all I felt and saw was darkness. Hang in there. It does get better! And if it doesn't... don't be afraid to ask for help. You're absolutely not alone.",beyondthebump
3,Did anyone else move in with their parents for the first few months &amp; was it helpful?,My parents (especially my mama) are extremely supportive &amp; wonderful.

4,Diaper rash remedies?,"8 month old daughter has a pretty bad diaper rash. it's not bad in size but in the area it is in, I can't get it to go away. I've tried hello bello brand diaper rash cream and Bordeaux butt paste and neither is clearing it up. I try to buy cleaner creams (I only used the butt paste because it's the only thing I had on hand and does work better than the hello bello. I would prefer to not use it though) I really don't want to have to go buy desitin just for this when the ingredients are no good. does anyone have any cleaner recommendations? I've seen Cetaphil has a diaper cream without the icky ingredients that desitin and butt paste have. has anyone used it? babyganics? Burts bees? other recommendations? Thanks!",beyondthebump
5,How and when did you introduce your dog to your newborn?,"Like many families my husband and I went for the one-two pandemic punch of getting a puppy last spring and are now expecting our first at the end of September. One thing we are nervous about is when &amp; how to introduce our very loving but excited dog to the new addition. I have been reading so many different things that vary from no contact for months to let them interact (supervised of course) pretty early on. 

Most of the arguments against early contact are about germs/sickness but I wonder if that can be mitigated by not letting to dog lick the babies mouth but otherwise hands/feet/bum might be okay area to sniff explore. The other thing I’m seeing is that if you keep the dog away from the kid so long they can feel like it’s competition and not part of the family.  

I will say our dog has met very unruly toddlers and was exceedingly gentle with them. She knows how much bigger she is than them (50 lb Australian Shepard) and tends to just let them pull/poke/prod/sit on her. I am very unconcerned about the dog lashing out but more wondering if there are other things I’m totally overlooking. Maybe I’m too lax about this  but I feel like I see videos of newborns around pups all the time and there is no imminent danger. 

All this to say for parents with younger dogs what is your experience/advice with this process?",beyondthebump

11,I wish I could have gotten a different kid.,"When she first came home 6 months ago, I remember waking up and peeking into her bassinet and every morning was like Christmas morning, I couldn't wait to spend the day with her. But that's not the case anymore. She doesn't bring me joy, she's something I have to endure.

She cries. Constantly. 

Reading is one of my favorite hobbies and I always imagined reading my kid(s) goodnight stories before bed. I had a list in my phone of books I'd read to them (yes, I know in the beginning they don't understand, but that's not the point). But she will not sit still  with me while I read to her. She just cries and throws herself around until I give up.

Today I was trying to organize her clothes (something else I always looked forward to), and I couldn't even enjoy doing that because she was sitting beside me just crying. I tried putting toys and household objects all around for her to explore, and it worked for about .5 seconds before she started crying.

She doesn't let me cuddle her. I just want to hold her close, kiss her cheeks, smell her head, but she just pushes away from me and cries. I'm also an exclusive pumper because she locks onto my nipple and then rips it as far away from my body as she can. Even if I could withstand that amount of pain, she will only eat for a few minutes before she starts crying and refuses to eat anymore (she eats from a bottle just fine). She won't even co-sleep. She refuses to fall asleep next to me, so now she sleeps in her own crib in her own room. I thought sleep training her would be a nightmare, but she actually stops crying the second I leave the room. It's like she prefers to be alone.

She's just so high-strung and volatile. She can never just relax and be happy. Even as a newborn, she was never a chilled out potato. Every doctor she saw commented on how alert she was. 

I cracked and ordered noise cancelling headphones because I just can't take it anymore. Nothing I do helps. She's fed, changed, not too hot/cold, loved, has toys, etc. (Trust me, nothing is wrong with her, I've explored EVERY possibility that this is a fixable issue, or something I'm doing wrong, and it's not, this is just her personality). Maybe she has a sensory issue, I don't know. But I do NOT have the personality to handle a special needs kid, so I really hope not.

I knew having a baby would be tough. I knew my life would be over for a good decade or so before the kid(s) became semi-self sufficient. But I didn't know it would be like this. In my mind, I pictured putting the baby in her bouncer and handing her a measuring cup to play with while I did the dishes for 5 minutes. That sort of thing. But she just throws the measuring cup immediately and begins to cry. So I pick it up and hand it back to her. Same thing. But picture that with every activity we try.

Don't get me wrong, she doesn't cry 24/7 (no baby does) and we have a few good moments. It's just that the bad moments outweigh the good by a landslide. 

My husband wants more kids, and I do too (we both always wanted three), but I'm terrified our next kid(s) will end up like her.

I don't wish I could go back in time and not get pregnant, I don't want to be childfree, I just wish I could go back in time and get a different baby. I feel so much guilt and sadness for feeling that way. And my husband doesn't understand my frustrations because like most Americans, he works all day. The hour or two he gets with her before bedtime isn't enough time for him to become annoyed with her.

I spend my days counting down the minutes until her next nap. 

I'm so disappointed.",beyondthebump

15,‘How’s it going?’,"Being almost two months into being a mother for the first time, I’ve gotten this question a lot and I haven’t always felt like I could tell the truth to the people that asked. So here’s how it’s actually going:


I’ll start with the not so great stuff:
I had two really bad fevers two weeks apart with cold sores in between. I wasn’t able to kiss my daughter or husband for weeks and that was difficult.
My baby has thrown up (like actual projectile vomiting) once a day on average since she was three weeks old. I’ve taken her to the ER and to the doctor twice and they don’t seem concerned because she’s gaining weight. I’m worried it might be a milk allergy, but can’t get confirmation because they think a referral is unnecessary and this is ‘just how some babies are’. Despite it happening so often, I’m still not used to it. Every time she pukes, my heart breaks and I feel like a failure as a mother. Sometimes it comes out of her nose.
Every letdown I’ve had since week two has been painful and I have a blocked duct in my right breast that won’t clear. I’ve done the following to try and get rid of it: hot compress, cold compress, feeding baby in literally every position/angle, massaging it, buzzing it with my electric toothbrush, squeezing it, getting my husband to try and suck it out, talking to it, shaking it, etc. It doesn’t hurt, but it’s driving me crazy. My right breast is also much bigger and fuller than the left, and produces more milk than baby can drink. It hurts and I look ridiculous. They used to be the same size.
My vagina still feels weird and sex is too painful to have. I thought it was fine and was disappointed when I learned it wasn’t.
I’m afraid of my baby dying of SIDS even though it’s rare and am counting down to the danger zone (when risk is highest from 2-4 months). The nightlight is more for me than her because I’m afraid of the dark again since I can’t see her face.


The good stuff:
I love her so much and feel lucky to be able to spend time with her. I’ve learned so much already. Like that she can get her boogers out on her own by rubbing her face on the blanket during tummy time. And that newborn nails practically cut themselves.
We’ve been doing elimination communication and have caught so many poops and pees, saving us quite a lot of diapers.
I’ve been feeling like singing again (I don’t when I’m sad) and sing to her almost daily.
My cat likes her and isn’t at all jealous.
She hasn’t cried more than 15 seconds at a time since she was born because I’m able to soothe her immediately (thank you, boobies).
She makes eye contact for longer periods of time now and I melt every time.
She laughs and smiles in her sleep and I can’t wait for it to happen when she’s awake.
Besides the vomiting, she’s a healthy little chonker and I’m so grateful. She had trouble breathing when she was born and there are no issues with that now.
I feel hopeful, more so than I have in a while and that feels good.



I guess things are going alright.",beyondthebump

20,Is this a normal habit with the soother?,"My baby girl is just about 3 months old, and although she is really good without needing her soother very often or at all, I've found she has started a weird habit over the last few days. I've never seen this with any other babies, I'm curious to know if you've experienced this? 

She doesn't care to be sucking on it, but if she has her soother she won't keep her hands away from it. She is constantly holding it, and trying to move it around her mouth, playing with it. 9 times out of 10 I'll catch her holding it sideways and just oddly pushing the nipple into her lips/gums, pulling her lips to the side, making the funniest faces lol. She very rarely ever uses it to soothe/suck on, it's mostly become a toy? I'm not sure if I should just be taking it away at this point, trying to introduce other things to hold (I'm slowly trying that but the soother is the only thing she will grasp). It's kind of crazy to see that this started only a few days ago, and it's the only thing she will do with it now!",beyondthebump

I am currently 28wks and my husband says he is having a hard time seeing me in a sexual way. He said it’s not like he finds me unattractive, but sex is the last thing he is thinking about.

24,Post maternity leave,"Need some advice! NBR…

I’m in a business to business sales position where I’m 100% commission at this point. I have a book of business that I’ve built over the course of five years, which is what my monthly paycheck consists of. The only expense my company has towards me is a portion of my monthly health insurance premium and employer 401k contributions. 

I had a baby six months ago and was on maternity leave for three months. Because of the unknown longevity of COVID, we didn’t enroll our baby in daycare. I’ve basically been maintaining my book of business, going into the office for a few hours a few days each month. I’m not actively selling any new business… just maintaining my existing clients. 

In a perfect world, I’d love to be able to maintain my book of business and raise my child (and other children we plan to have), and return to actively selling when our children start school. I understand it’s part of the sales/retention cycle, to lose accounts over time, and I’m okay with that. I love the company I work for, and wouldn’t want to work for anyone else. My company is a family owned business who cares deeply about family values, and stresses the importance of faith and family. 

All of that being said, I feel like I’m on the chopping block for some reason. Historically, I’ve been a top salesperson and a great employee. 

Do you think I’m worthy of firing? Do you think it seems fair to let me continue being an employee of the company, by just maintaining my book of business without bringing in new sales while I raise my babies? Opinions?",beyondthebump
25,After being pregnant back to back for two years - I was having intense back pain and feeling extremely stiff. Just so uncomfortable in my body,"A month ago I started yoga again after not doing it for a few years. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to do anything at all. That’s why I put it off for so long! My daughter was born at the end of May and she was my last, so I want to get back into shape.

I tried Yoga with Adrienne, her complete beginner video. I sucked at it lol. But she’s so good at explaining and walking you through the steps that I came back for more and have done it frequently. I’ve even noticed myself correcting my posture while running errands. 

The best part? I’ve been sleeping again (minus wake ups for baby) and by the end of the day my back doesn’t ache like I spent the day doing hard labor. 

I hope this post is ok, I don’t want it to sound like an advertisement. I’ve just always been to shy to try yoga and too awkward to understand how to put my body into the positions.

26,Daycare providers/parents-need tips and advice please!!!,"I need some tips and advice for my son going to daycare. He is two months today, and won’t be going to daycare until he is 6 months (I know it’s 4 months away, but I want to start helping him in any way I can). I am wondering what are some things I can start doing for him today to help his transition at daycare. I used to work in daycares for almost 10 years and I know they are resilient and they will get used to it, but there has to be some things I can help with. 
For example- to get my son down for a nap, I have to bounce him, slap his back (yes he likes to be slapped hard lol) and shush him loudly for about ten minutes. I know when he is 6 months this may be different but I’m worried I am creating a bad habit for him and his teachers will not have time to do this with him. 

So I guess my question is how can I help the transition be easier for him from being home with me for 6 months to a daycare, I’m already a stressed mama. Thanks!",beyondthebump
27,How can I make my baby (14w) hate the pram less?,"I feel like I've exhausted all options and it's making leaving the house pretty difficult. 95% of the time I'm pushing and empty pram with baby in the carrier

My gut feeling is that she is bored as she starts off with small whimpers which quickly escalates into full on purple crying. I've tried toys, talking to her, rocking the pram, tired/awake, white noise and anything I can think of.

Initially she loves the bassinet but reflux put an end to that very prematurely. We then resorted to using the car seat attachment for short trips only but that didn't last long.

We have now moved her into the pram attachment early (it's designed for 6months+). She seems very secure, has great head/neck control and we only use it on the lie-flat setting, or very rarely on the first tilt for short bursts i.e. to prevent a meltdown (never works!) But that's stopped working too and she's so unhappy every time we go out. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this? Did it get better?! Do I just give up and use the carrier?",beyondthebump
28,I survived my baby’s first day of daycare!,"I had SO much anxiety about sending my 4mo back. She had been refusing the bottle from my husband at home and I could only trick her into taking it. I was worried she’d starve and cry the whole time. 

She ended up eating quite a bit at daycare, took normal naps with normal wake windows AND slept through the night still! 

I know it’s only the first day, but I feel relieved knowing she will be ok. Babies are so resilient! To anyone that is sending their little one to daycare for the first time after being in quarantine, I want to offer a positive story and that you got this! 

Not looking forward to her getting her first cold though 😄.

30,Would you feed a 7mo minestrone?,"I have a 7mo who eats pretty much everything we give her, except for a couple of things she doesn't like. I recently started shifting her to our food (if it isn't spicy or difficult to eat) because she likes it- if we're having fish and veggies she'll have the same, just a little simpler (I.e. fewer things in her bowl). 

I made a big-ass pot of minestrone today, and it's got a ton of veggies in it, and a tiny bit of spice (just a pinch of curry for flavour, it doesn't burn at all). Is this maybe too much?

31,Intact 9mo has 4 diapers in 24 hours? HELP!,"Hello everyone, I may be making a fuss over nothing but what else can be expected of a FTM?

My son doesn't pee during the day, if he does it's maybe an ounce or two here and there when he absolutely can't hold it anymore. ALL of his pee is during sleep. He's 9 months today so I sincerely doubt it's a readiness for potty training. He's breastfed, but also has as much water as he asks for during the day along with his other foods. We have had no issues with rash, redness, yeast, or anything of the like. Peeing doesn't hurt him, he doesn't balloon but he does ""push"". His pediatrician does not understand what I'm asking and didn't let me make an appointment for an exam, said once every 36 hours is fine. They've said he has a small opening (nope, sphincters perfectly). Is this something I should be concerned about? How is he holding it until? I literally can't find a single article on this anywhere. Help me! 😭

he pees a LOT at night. Maybe 6 times, wakes up each time and the diaper is practically hanging off by the morning. He nurses frequently during the night, but isn't a slouch during the day either with anywhere from 4-5 sessions. He sleeps 11 hours at night and 3 during the day. The amount of diapers depends on how many individual naps he takes. 3 1hour naps= 3 diapers. 1 3hour nap= 1 diaper. This can't be normal.",beyondthebump
32,2 weeks in: My 5 hard-earned lessons,"We didn’t agree to this but it naturally fell into place that the wife feeds/weans and I take care of just-in-time supplies and the morning lightbathe; both of us of course bewildered from sleepless diaper-change/soothe/burp bootcamp nightly triathlons (we feel like we timewarped back to 1996 standing outside entrances of various warehouses from midnight to 4 am, clubhopping from rave to rave, and the bouncer looking at the age on our IDs doesn’t let us in, repeating ‘WTF are you two doing here, you’re too old for this, you ought to be doing yoga and shit’). 

**The 5 things keeping us going :**

1. nonstop attitude of humor &amp; positivity  
2. daily spooning for a few minutes, or at least a hug  
3. sensitive empathy to force the other to let go and nap it off when we see them bloodshot and slurry-speeched  
4. tapping into the service-economy (apps to order househelp, prepped food, grocery delivery)  
5. weekly ‘reset’ for us both where we offload the creature for a couple of hours to someone else and collapse (e.g. an aunt, babysitter’s, grandparent/in-law, off-duty midwife, doula, in our case vicarious milk-mother — closest thing to a village in 2021)

But that respite-caregiver should NOT move into your house to share the load, because they’ll skirmish over how to parent … a bad BAD BAAD idea with a crying baby and a post-natal-depression-prone mama.

33,Bottle hygiene hacks,"For energy efficiency, I put in place a routine system for milk-bottle readiness**.** Between every 2 hours I need to turn around used dirty bottles to ready-to-drink formula mixes or dry pump-machine components. **Here’s what I learned — and DIY’d — so far:**

* Used fancy machines I bought beforehand seemed easier but cleaning and maintaining them proved a major chore (one was designed for taps in colder environments than mine and is even fussier about water temperature than our baby is, another had a dozen parts to descale).   
\- Way easier to do it like humans did for thousands of years just boiling water and letting it sit in a heat-insulated flask as needed to mix formula if the breasts ain’t enough  
\- Premixed ready-to-drink disposable bottles at night/emergencies reduces nighttime cleaning
* What really accelerated the washing-up for me is putting 2 waterfilled buckets in my bathtub like back-alley roadkill kitchens… 1 for on-the-go cleaning and 1 for rinsing. Creamy stinky bottles &amp; pump components I quickly dump &amp; immerse in one and let sit for a while, then dip in another adjacent with just plain water, and finally next to that it goes on a drying rock with poles … so like an assembly line. Mucky waters get tossed and replenished only 1nce a day. I ordered an extra set of every bottle, teat, and component to cycle through when unused. Sterilizer tablets in bucket 1 I found leaving bottles strongly smelling of chlorine despite using the recommended dilution, so I now drop in table salt &amp; those fake restaurant lemon juice squirts… healthier and IT WORKS GREAT! That’s the daily. I found that now at the 2-week mark, milk fat has still built up in the bottles, so I pop them in a steam sterilizer if need be which auto-shuts down after 30 mins

**Still to figure out: DRYING.** Water droplets aren’t a big deal for milk bottles but really bad for the expensive breast pump’s air line. Microwave won’t work for me for a few reasons. Blow dryer too much effort. I am eyeing trying the UV Bulb sterilizer that I bought during lockdown for my phone/keys at the door — the one used in hair salons — as a possible fix…. Open to any experiences with that!",beyondthebump

36,So over the granny police: my mini rant,"In the country we live in it's pretty common for elderly people, particularly elderly ladies, to comment on young kids and babies to their parents as to what, in their opinion, you are Epically Fucking Up. 

""Why does the baby not have a hat and socks on??"" (in 29 C/84 F weather) God forbid, they could catch a goddamn cold in peak August weather by not having hats and socks obviously!!!!

""Keep an eye on your child, this is not a playground!"" (in the grocery store, said child is literally holding my hand, at my side, helping me pick out a box of crackers and doing absolutely nothing wrong or out of control)

""Did you know your baby is eating that?"" (after seeing me hand a piece of food to the kid on my back in the back carrier...a particularly confusing question, meaning what exactly? Do I know they are eating the exact food I gave them? Do I know they are eating a piece of food, which is usually what food is intended for? ""That,"" meaning a food you personally do not approve of?)

Today's gem: the old lady who lives on the 5th floor, whom I always open the door and gate for and often take in packages for and have literally never done anything wrong to (nor have my kids) made a special trip to my apartment door while I was trying to change my toddler's diaper and cook lunch, that my 5 year old pressed *an extra button in the elevator.*

40,Partner wakes up baby every night,"Y’all. I’m gonna lose my mind here. I posted a few weeks ago about my partner going off on me for wanting to bottle feed. Luckily I was able to talk sense into him and he now takes over late night feedings. However a new issue has arisen and I cannot for the life of me understand how his brain works.

As mentioned before, he will take late night (12am feedings) so I can catch a few more zzz’s. Partner has to wake up early and I’m still on leave, so I offered to cover all feedings tonight. He then proceeds to tell me that for midnight feedings he will play with our daughter until she is fully awake then will proceed to turn on the living room lights and watch tv with her while he feeds her. What the fuck? When asked why, he said it was the only way he could make sure she ate enough. Am I crazy? Does this make any sense?

My partner has been kind of uptight about his parenting choices - like insisting I only feed by breast instead of bottle until I was able to get the pediatrician to tell him bottles were ok. I didn’t really argue with him about his late night feeding methods since I’m not up for an argument....but wtf.",beyondthebump

She's had a bright red rash around her vulva for the past four days or so. I thought putting diaper cream on it could help because she's had a rash before, and that was recommended by the doctor and did it. But it hasn't seemed to improve this time.

The longest stretch we’ve had was about 40 minutes in there. But with his change to being a lighter sleeper, it’s impossible to transfer him out of my arms to elsewhere without him peeping his eyes open and stirring, waking up, then usually crying. It can be such minimal movement and it has him up. I’m generally waiting til 20-30 minutes in my arms before trying to transfer, either after feeding, rocking, or bouncing on our exercise ball.

60,First time parent. So many questions!,"I’m searching for some advice/answers for any of my random questions below! Thank you for any insight you can offer!

Some background info: 
I’m a first time mom of a beautiful 5-week old baby boy. Due to some latching and milk transferring issues, right now, feeding consists of nursing a bit, but the majority of his calories are fed via a bottle (my expressed breastmilk). So we are essentially triple feeding. Nursing, bottle, pumping. 


Questions:

1.) I’m having a hard time figuring out when to pump when I also need to care for the baby. Sometimes the timing works out where I’ll pump during his nap. Other times,
I’ll get him settled in his bassinet, thinking he’s good to go for a nap, but he fusses and begins crying/screaming. So I have to stop the pumping session to deal with him — usually spilling milk everywhere because I brilliantly try to bend over and pick him up with all the pump parts still attached. Any advice for how to pump while caring for the baby? I’ve tried to balance him on a knee while also pumping, and it’s pretty challenging. Especially if he’s fussy and needs real attention. 

2.) Best bottles for paced bottle feeding? 

3.) If I misjudge a wake period…should I keep him swaddled and in crib? And how do I know if I’ve misjudged a wake window? In other words, he’s fed, has a fresh diaper, is soothed, and is swaddled. The white noise machine is going. I lay him down, and he quietly lies in his bassinet with his adorable big eyes just looking around for the longest time. (I’m referring to day time, by the way.) After a while, when he’s STILL quietly awake, I begin to feel so badly and think this was meant to be a wake window. So should I let him just continue to lie there awake? Or should I unswaddle him and interact with him? How do I know if it’s a wake window or just an unsuccessful nap time? Is it bad to keep a baby swaddled who isn’t asleep? 

4.) Is it possible to overfeed the baby? We are trying to be very conscientious of following his feeding cues and letting that guide our feeds…but he seems to be gaining a LOT of weight. Well over the 5-7 ounces per week that is average. 

5.) Is it normal to be constantly aware and/or moderately concerned that I could fall down the stairs holding the baby, moving from one floor of my house to the next? It’s something I think about all the time. 

6.) The constant boob leaking. Please! Give me your advice! Do I have to literally wear a bra 24/7 until my breastfeeding journey is over? This is annoying especially at night. Also, what causes it specifically? Is there a trigger I can be aware of, so I can prepare?

7.) I have been using disposable breast pads in my bra. But my boobs…shift around? And it seems like my nipples always find a way to not be covered by the pad…and therefore still leak through the bra and shirt at times! (I can only imagine how fun this will be in front of my seventh grade students in a few months. Ha.) Do breast pads work well for you? Any tips for me?

8.) So far, 5 weeks into parenthood, one of the most surprising “symptoms” is so much back pain! Bending over, lifting, carrying, holding. Most of all, the diaper changing station is a at ridiculously low height in the Pack n Play. Is this just something we all go through?  

9.) Too many kisses? Is this a possibility? I cannot stop kissing my beautiful baby boy. What a precious little angel. Do all parents just smother their babies with kisses every five seconds?",beyondthebump

63,help baby will not stay full during night only?,"Baby is 4 weeks old as of a few days ago and she’s been like this since maybe the 7-12 day mark of her life? She is never satisfied with how much food she gets only at night. 

I nurse her throughout the day every 3 hours and then top her off with usually 40ml after each feed since I usually don’t produce much. She then goes to sleep just fine and wakes up by herself at the 3 hour mark for her next feed. At night my partner formula feeds her 3oz or 90ml at night and she gets so fussy and does this heartbreaking scream making her sound like she’s in pain and straining her voice when she finishes the bottle and the only way to soothe her is if we give her more food but the problem is we don’t want to overfeed her! Some nights she will go up to 120ml of a mix of formula and breast milk and some nights if she’s still acting hungry after an absurd amount of formula then my partner will wake me up to nurse her and she’ll fall asleep within 10mins of being nursed 

So I was wondering how much formula is enough/too much for a 4 week old and if anyone knew why she is only really hungry at night ☹️",beyondthebump

My exclusively breastfed baby is six weeks old (one week adjusted but born 6 lbs and no NICU time) and has had reflux symptoms since week two, which I have read is common for preemies. Her reflux is not severe, consisting of spitting up a few tsp  3-4 times a day and some discomfort while eating and right after (grunting and back arching), but not enough to make her stop eating, as well as choking on my milk a few times a day and coughing 2-3x a day, sounds like from regurgitate. Poops are fine. We keep her upright 30 min after eating and have added risers to the head of her bassinet which definitely helps, but hasn’t completely eliminated her discomfort. I have been toying with doing allergen elimination, starting with just dairy first as both my husband and I have a mild sensitivity to dairy ourselves (mostly just gas/ mild stomach pain) so suspect she does too. We just live with it because we love dairy. I eat a lot of dairy these days but I think I can live with plant alternatives to most things, except perfect bars,which contain nonfat milk powder. I love them so much, and they are such a god send with a new baby and a breastfeeding appetite, as they are high in calories and easy to eat as a meal replacement .

77,Is this emotional baiting?,"So I’m apart of this retail group online. Daily theres at least one post or mention how they wish they had an item that is sold out for their child, while displaying a pic of their child whom has an illness.

Now while I’m not against these postings, part of me can’t help but feel like it’s become emotional bait. They can literally post several other items and a pic of their lo but instead they post about wishing they had an item which hundreds wish they could have too. Am I wrong for feeling like this is emotional bait? Some times items are given away for free, and 100% of the time it goes to a child with illness. I think this what makes it like bait for these parents. Bc they know it’s given to children with illness so then we see more and more of these posts. Which I’m totally ok with but wonder what does that mean for parents who have a totally healthy child but cannot attain the same nor have the means. 

Now you would think I’m thinking this way Bc I’d be one of those parents but I’m not. Ive been VERY lucky to get a hold of this particular item for retail. Not once but twice and I honestly don’t care for it. The first time I got it I was completely shocked I even got it -i didn’t realize I got the wrong size. I sold it for what I paid. The second time I literally did it for this person. So I kindly asked the person if they could pay me back retail for the item they claimed they wanted. Now this second time I feel like I got caught in one of these emotional bait post situations where i have to give up my item for free. After asking they came back super nasty at me and said I was making them uncomfortable. And now idk how to feel. I feel like these items end up being more for the parent than the child. Help me sort my thoughts and heart here plz.

82,So overwhelmed 😮‍💨 Toddler and newborn.,Second time mom with a 16 month old and a week old. My pregnancy was pretty difficult but my labor was quick. A little to quick. My sweet girl broke her clavicle on the way out. Now she’s in pain and needy. She only wants breast access and I can only hold her/handle her just so. I’m so exhausted from hours and hours of feeding and rocking and feeding and not sleeping m.

I know it gets easier and this stage doesn’t last but in the moment it often feels like it will never change. I remember with my first this insane burst of just overwhelm. I don’t know what else to call it. Just going from normal emotion and mostly carefree life to completely full and overflowing with so many emotions and so much feeling of responsibility. I honestly thought it was a new mom thing. And that I wouldn’t feel so incredibly overwhelmed again with my second. But I do. In fact it’s so much stronger because I’m once again overwhelmed with the responsibility of making sure I don’t neglect my toddler while I’m bonding with my newborn. And the intense feelings of love and worry and pride. So much frustration and anxiety and joy and fear. So much all the time every second. Don’t get me wrong I’m filled with happiness that my toddler loves her sister. That my husband is such a great partner and that we have two healthy babies.

I feel like he's been able to connect more to the baby even though the baby is literally inside me. 

My pregnancy was a surprise even with contraception. Not that I didn't want kids but just wasn't exposed to them much throughout my life. Friends have no kids etc. I've never felt particularly maternal if that makes sense. I just thought I would have gotten pregnant when I was ""ready"". 

Pregnancy has been rough on me and absolutely not like how everyone has said it would be. I've just stopped vomiting as of last week. I'm still reeling over what has happened over the last 3 months where i was basically bed ridden except for the bathroom. Lost 19pounds. The nausea was debilitating. I questioned whether I would even get through it. Talking, showering, moving, basically being awake made me want to puke. I can't believe its mid august. I still have the nausea but at least I've stopped puking. I'm till trying to find my way around food.. For some reason don't have much appetite if at all. Doctors just said that it was normal for some women and my tests were all normal except that I was anaemic at 10 weeks. I had to depend on my husband for everything. 

So I want to be prepared for postpartum because.. No one told me pregnancy was going to be so rough on me and everyone just said that it was normal but I knew no one, not even friends of friends who lost as much weight or was as sick as I was.. so that I can at least set my expectations. 

The thing about pregnancy is I know it ends, labour ends. I kind of feel like a bad mom because I was always complaining during pregnancy, crying about how shit it was, honestly feeling like I couldn't do it and I couldn't take it. I felt kind of unworthy to this baby.

I'm worried postpartum will feel the same way.. Am I alone in this? 

I know my husband will be quite hands on. In our culture we have strict postpartum care for mothers where I can't do any housework for about 40-50 days post partum and get herbal baths, sits bath, masks, hot stone compress, wraps, massages, scrubs and nutrition. It seems that the aim is to let a mother heal and not get stressed too much during such an important time. I plan to try and keep to it for that time period strictly before slowly weaning off all treatments. My husband wants to help with the baby and my treatments (they're all usually prepacked and all we need to do is mix them with the water or heat them up etc. We might even get a doula for one of those weeks but just to save some money we might not. The doula will cover all my treatments and help with taking care of the baby though. I think my MIL will also be around to help with the extra other things but things aren't set in stone. I worry it will be overwhelming for my husband but he has been taking care of me this whole time and has been cooking and doing housework since I've been glued to the bed. 

Any advice or tips that made your postpartum recovery easier? I'm worried about having no sleep. I am a light sleeper and honestly just dont function well without it. Any websites with a comprehensive guide to postpartum that you guys follow? I notice its easier for me to just read from one source vs reading from so many contradicting sources. Any tips for my husband? I feel like he is going to be taking the brunt of all the work for the first few weeks after I give birth. I feel bad enough that I was so needy during pregnancy because I've always been so independent, on the move, and on top of everything.",beyondthebump
84,Anyone here diagnosed with cancer while pregnant? Or parents who needed to cut breastfeeding early?, Hello everyone! Just wondering if any other mamas have been diagnosed with cancer while pregnant? Recently diagnosed with stage 2 metastatic papillary thyroid cancer that likely has spread into the lymph nodes in my neck. The prognosis is good but my breastfeeding journey with my incoming October 2021 baby is going to be cut very short due to the need for surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. I want to make the best out of the 6 or so weeks I will be able to breastfeed. My last child refused to use a bottle when I attempted to use pumped milk. I couldn't leave my house without her until she was 8 months and capable of using a sippy. I'd love to avoid those issues again by possibly introducing pumped milk early on (two-ish weeks?). Is there anyone who has gone through this and can offer any advice? I have about 6 to 8 weeks before this baby will make his entrance and I want to have a plan.,beyondthebump
85,Baby hates NOT being at home.,"I can’t take my 3.5 month old anywhere. Can’t go on walks. Can’t go on car rides. He screams the entire time, and I mean bloody murder, big mad type screams. Red in the face, real tears down his cheeks screaming. 

I’ve tried carriers: combo, structured and a ring sling. I’ve tried his stroller with his car seat attached and without. Laying down, sitting up, halfway between the two. 

In the car, we’ve tried the bucket seat and a convertible forever seat. 

NOTHING will calm this kid down. He screams like he’s in pain or angry whenever we leave the apartment. 

Anyone, anywhere have any idea why he’d be like this? Anyone dealt with this before? It’s stressing me the hell out because I HAVE to walk our dog twice a day bc I’m the only one home during the day and we don’t have a yard. I get to go on two scream filled walks every single day.

She’ll go off to go potty (she’s been going alone for months before brother was born) and come back with wet undies and shorts. We’ll only figure it out when we pick her up or she sits on one of us and sometimes she even denies it like doesn’t want to attention for it. When I ask if she did it on purpose she gets a huge smile and says yes and just now told me “I like to pee my pants”. I’m at a loss of what to do, please help!",beyondthebump

102,Struggling hard,"Hi! First time mom, LO is 4 months. Had a natural birth. I’m not really asking for advice. I just need to get this off my chest to people who won’t judge me and who will be supportive. It’s a long read. Thank you anyone who takes the time to read it. 

Disclaimer: I’ve talked to Husband, T, about all of the things I’m going to rant about. We seem to have the same conversations over and over again and nothing changes. From my point of view, it only seems like he takes me seriously if I’m crying. It takes a lot to get me to the crying stage. It’s frustrating because I ask for things to change and they don’t, so why bother asking. I also find that T has a lot of deflections and excuses when I try to bring things up. It makes me shut down and give up. 

I have a lot of my own trauma I am bringing to this relationship and we both know that. Daddy issues, abusive prior relationship (I was in therapy for awhile but stopped going as I didn’t think my therapist was a good fit for me. It’s a 12-18 month wait to get a new one now because of Covid.) 
It’s hard for me to put myself first or ask for help. I had hoped after 9 years together he would recognize and know that and try to reach out more. I know I have my own work to do on my end. I don’t want to make T seem like the bad guy, but I am really struggling. 

I think I might have postpartum depression.  I experience many of the symptoms I’ve looked at online including depressed mood or severe mood swings, excessive crying (sometimes), inability to sleep (even though exhausted), overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy, reduced interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, intense irritability and anger, fear that you're not a good mother, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy, diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions, restlessness, and severe anxiety.
I’m hesitant to go to the doctor. I really don’t want to take medication. Plus I don’t really like my doctor. 

I was vulnerable with T and told him what I was experiencing. I had hoped he would notice that I’m not okay, but hasn’t, so I explained this list to him and again I feel like nothing has changed. As long as I act like I’m fine, he accepts that. Again, I know I need to be more vulnerable but I feel like my needs aren’t being met at all. 

I don’t want to join support groups or talk to other moms. In fact, talking to other moms or reading blogs makes me super anxious. I just feel like I’m not doing anything right. I feel so much judgement (real or just perceived) and it makes me so anxious. 

I also feel very lonely. We live I’m the country and it’s a 30 minute drive to the closest stores and to my family and it’s more like 45+ minutes to good stores and most of my friends. His family is out here, more about them later. LO doesn’t do well in the car and I feel very trapped. It’s a long way for most people to come and visit and it’s a long way for me to take her in the car and do anything. I know she’s only 4 months old and her awake time will get longer and she’ll have more of a solid routine eventually and hopefully she won’t scream in the car after 15 minutes. I’m just finding it really hard right now. Especially when it’s summer and all my friends and my mom have time off (we’re all teachers). 

I told T this is why I wanted to move before the baby. With the housing market the way it is, it doesn’t seem like we’ll move anytime soon. I feel like this is really contributing to my feelings of hopelessness. 

I am also feeling a lot of pressure to have sex. The only compliments I’m getting from T are about my body. Which is nice, don’t get me wrong, I want to be attractive to my husband, but that’s all I feel I’m getting. I keep telling him that I don’t exist for his pleasure. We tried to have sex a few times but it was painful. Last weekend we just had sex. I just wanted to get it over with so he would leave me alone. I don’t want to have this attitude towards sex but this where I’m at. Sex has always been really complicated for me. In my previous relationship I experienced a lot of sexual violence and trauma. T knows this, and again, I was hoping for some more understanding from him about it. 

I’m also having a really hard time being the lead parent and the lead person in our relationship. I’m tired of having to tell him everything. Planning dinner, doing chores, making our schedule, the emotional heavy lifting, looking up things for the baby, etc etc. 

I really feel like he doesn’t see me and even when I am vulnerable enough to share something, I don’t feel I get what I need. 
He doesn’t look anything up about the baby or about how to help me with my traumas or how to support a woman experiencing PPD or anything. I have to tell him to do that. Even then, he’s done it maybe twice and hasn’t implemented anything he’s read, as far as I can tell. 
It reinforces my beliefs that I’m not important and I don’t matter because he won’t take the initiative or make the effort.  If I’m angry he doesn’t understand (after many conversations) that it’s not usually the small thing I’m upset about. It’s the straw that broke the camel’s back. We seriously have the same conversations about our relationship over and over and I feel that nothing changes or gets better. Things aren’t **bad** necessarily, but I’m also not happy. 

T’s family live like 5 minutes away from us. They are racist, bigoted, and judgmental. I can tolerate them if we stick to small talk like sports, but it never just stays at small talk. They make me feel judged and anxious. T has expressed to me that he needs me to be less negative about his family, especially about seeing them. He knows how I feel about them, but it’s hard for him to hear me be negative about them all the time. I am trying really hard. Pushing down my feelings about this is again, making me feel like I don’t matter. 

He also wants to continue to see his friends or have them come over. He wants to get high (cannabis is legal here) and play video games etc. I feel that it’s not fair that he gets all this free time but I don’t. (Not that there’s a solution here since I’m exclusively breast feeding, no pumping, and I wouldn’t want to leave her anyway). 
Even just watching him get high or drink with his friends is hard. Not that I miss it that much, it’s just so in my face that he’s happy and having fun and I’m not. He’ll ask my permission to do things and I don’t know what to say. I don’t want him to see our relationship that way. Where I’m “in charge” and he has to ask me to hang out with his friends. I want him to make a responsible choice. But so far he’s proved that he’ll choose what he wants. 

There’s just so much piling up. My festering resentment, sex, I’m always hungry from breast feeding, LO is going through a sleep regression or teething or both, so I’m not getting a lot of sleep. We are getting along day to day just fine. But overall I am feeling lonely and hopeless. I love my baby with all my heart. She makes everything worth it, but this whole postpartum experience has been really hard. 

I’m really not trying to make T seem like the bad guy. He’s a good guy and he wants to be a good dad. He does the dishes without being asked and will play with LO when he’s off work. He’s getting more comfortable with LO and will change diapers, too.  I know he loves me and he loves LO. He’s not doing anything maliciously. I think he doesn’t understand how I need to be loved and seems unwilling to put in the effort because everything is good from his POV. The house is clean, home made dinner every night, happy baby, etc. I wish I was selfish enough to break down and show him how much I’m suffering. But I can’t give myself that permission. 

Anyway, I guess all I wanted to do was say that I’m struggling and get this off my chest and talk to someone other than T.

106,"Parents who felt regret, when did it end?","I’ll start by saying I love my son and would do anything for him but this is awful. I had a really, really hard pregnancy but this is 10x worse, 100x worse. 

6 weeks and it’s worse. My kid has colic and gets hysterical at the breast in the evenings and won’t latch. Like literal 4-5 hours of hysterical crying and screaming. I can’t eat dinner because it’s too stressful. My husband is a saint and dies most of the calming bc I can’t handle it. He won’t take a bottle. 

Last night he was up every 30-45 minutes and hasn’t slept more than 2 hours since we had him. We already bedshare and he wakes up so so easily. When I put him in the crib he doesn’t sleep longer than 30 min, often not longer than 5 min.

We contact nap together during the day, I know it’s not safe but we do it as safe as possible and I wouldn’t be surviving otherwise.

He's never been one to hit 12 times a day. He generally only nurses 8, sometimes 9 or 10 (during what I believe were growth spurts). He's almost 10 weeks old. He's got a doctors appointment tomorrow, so I plan to ask the pediatrician, but I can't help but worry in the meantime. He's my first and I had real bad PPA in the beginning.

My LO (4months) has recently started sleeping on her side/on her back and I’m not sure if it’s okay to leave her like that. Most posts on here say that if baby can roll from back to tummy-tummy to back then it’s okay to leave her, but my baby can only go from back to tummy. During tummy time, she has enough neck power to hold her head up but she gets tired eventually and she drops her head face down. 
 
She is currently asleep on her tummy, her head tilted to the side. She has no pillows or blankets, only a fitted sheet. From time to time she lifts her head up a bit and goes back to sleep.

She is going through sleep regression (I think..?) and I would really want to let her sleep like this, but I end up checking her every 5 mins to see if she is still breathing okay..

My husband and I are planning to start trying for a baby soon, and as I think about how our lives will change with a little one, I am concerned about my job.

113,Would you go to your SIL's engagement party?,"I am extremely risk averse. Always have been. A work conference I went to a few years ago had a ""casino night"" event where the chips had zero relation to real money and there were no prizes - if you ran out of chips they would literally just hand you a new bucket - and still I was betting one chip at a time on hands of blackjack until my conference buddies teased me into taking bigger chances. While drinking. In my 20s.

I have been pretty hard-line about protecting our 10-month-old from COVID. She has only met in person with family and friends who I know are vaxed and are still being careful anyway. She has never been inside a public building other than her pediatrician's office. I have consistently masked indoors around people I don't trust to be vaccinated or don't know their status, even when it was no longer mandated for vaxed folks. 

My SIL has been extremely cavalier about the pandemic - she got COVID early on (only symptom was loss of smell) and has been traveling, going to unmasked parties, etc. ever since. She and her fiance did get vaccinated, but made it pretty clear that they only did so because they were going to a destination wedding in Mexico and were concerned about being able to get back into the US afterwards.

They are having an engagement party next month, at fiance's parents' house. The invitation doesn't mention COVID precautions at all, and I have no idea how many people are invited, whether it'll be indoors or out, etc. The little I know about fiance and his parents lead me to believe his family may or may not be in the ""no-vax"" camp, and I'm almost certain they won't be requiring or even encouraging their guests to mask.

What would you do in this situation??? Obviously I need to have a conversation with my husband, but like... do I lead with not wanting to go at all? Ask him to contact the hosts for more information first (he is going to RSVP for us since it's his sister)? I just can't stand the thought of bringing COVID home to bb if there's ANY chance of that happening.

I guess I'm just looking for validation here, because I'm sure you can tell what I'm leaning towards.

119,Emergency C-section recovery advice needed.,"On Friday I ended up having an emergency C-section after nearly 24 hours of a hormonal drip during which I got to 4cm and somehow regressed back to 2cm 😬😬 (apparently DS moved his head position). I was induced with a balloon on 10th Aug, and in hospital since then until discharge on the 15th.

I was not expecting a C-section, and obviously didn't make a plan for how to cope post-baby. I already have another DS (3), and am lucky enough that DH has a month of paid paternity leave. If he didn't have that, I am clueless how I'd actually survive without him. 

I've found I can't get in and out of bed at all without help, so have had to set up a makeshift bed on the sofa temporarily. Unfortunately sleep doesn't come enough for me to feel like I'm healing. Since last Tuesday (10th Aug) I've had naps of a maximum of 4 hours each time. Definitely sleep deprived and not by the newborn as DH is on it like a trooper. 


It's overwhelming and I'm honestly just struggling going to pee. Let alone feeling connected to both newborn and my toddler (who is also a trooper and I couldn't ask for DS2 to have a better older brother).

Flash forward to actual baby, and reading to a potato seemed ridiculous. Did my baby understand any of this? She's super alert, and I like to think smart, but since the womb, SO wiggly and cannot be contained, hates sitting, and so can barely focus on a book in front of her. 
    
Now that baby's awareness has increased at 8 months, I'm wondering if it's time to dig back in. She half sat still for a board book I showed her yesterday. But she'd still much rather practice walking and is literally obsessed with her walking tool. Will she chill for reading pictures soon? Hope so.",beyondthebump

If the baby suffocated in their non perfectly fitted crib sheet wouldn't the cause of death be suffocation and not 'unexplained'? Also this whole thing about it being safe after baby's a year old... Is that just because they stop calling it SIDS after that? That condition is in the definition of the term... It's utter bullshit like 'colick'.

Basically, the photo showed me and my son with him straight out of the hoohah on my chest and we all know that immediately afterwards, the medical team will start pushing on your stomach to stop the blood clotting and aid with getting the placenta out. In the picture, I was making the most horrendous face of pain and obviously, I looked like crap from 20hours of labor. I also wanna say I don’t have the highest self-esteem, so when I saw what he sent to his family I immediately felt shame. But most importantly I felt violated. This was the second picture he sent to people of me in pain during labor that I didn’t know or consent to and I just felt numb. Afterwards, I told him I no longer trusted him taking pictures of me and have been in therapy for my personal issues. But even so, I still feel anger and icky whenever I pass by people posting their afterbirth because I know that my first time experiencing that will forever be remembered as that one image while he has plenty of better shots that I took for everyone to see.

I guess what I’m saying is that I don’t want to feel this way towards him or that photo anymore, but I can’t help it. I’ve discussed this with my therapist and they suggested to have a clear conversation with him and I have multiple times, but each time I end up feeling worse because all he does is apologize and I get it, he sincerely feels sorry but for some reason this feels as if my nudes were sent out without my knowledge. I don’t know what to do. Is there any advice on how to fix this feeling over a picture?",beyondthebump

I have been with my husband for 5 years total. I have always gotten along with his mother very well and have had plenty of great times with her. She was over the moon excited when we announced that we had a baby on the way. She showered us with love and gifts. I thought this was going to bring us closer together than ever - it has not. I have become a much more protective mom than what I ever thought. There are a handful of people that I trust with my son, but over these past 6 months I feel like she is not one of them. She loves my son endlessly, but I have noticed some things that I am not comfortable with:
She gets so busy with showing him off that she forgets to care for him. I have seen her carry him around to all her friends and not listen to his hunger or sleep cues until he is totally upset. This is even after my gentle nudges to give him back to me, but she insists that he just needs ""grandma snuggles"" and continues on. 
She will also often tell me that after holding my son, she is not able to use her arm the next day or her back will totally blow out. This terrifies me if something were to happen to her while my son is in her care.

147,Migraines while lactating,"I commented over on r/shitmomgroupssay that I was experiencing migraines related to lactating and I got a couple responses from women saying they had the same experience. Because of that, I wanted to share on this sub a little more about it.


I'm 10 weeks PP and recently I came down with the most horrendous, debilitating migraine with nausea. I couldn't even keep down water. Advil didn't do anything. I felt incredibly thirsty but also like I was retaining water and bloated. I was just vomiting the whole day and couldn't look at light. I used to take promethazine for menstrual migraines but didn't want to take it while breastfeeding. I haven't had a menstrual migraine in about 5 years but still have some of the meds.


The next few days I had some lingering twinges of headache and my eyes still hurt. When I got home, I contacted my doctor and told her everything. She asked when the last time I had a migraine like that was and I told her that it was when I was breastfeeding my toddler 2 years ago. When I said I felt like I had a solute imbalance (desperately thirsty yet bloated and unable to keep water down) she said what I was experiencing was consistent with malnutrition related to breastfeeding, specifically, lack of protein. She is sending me in for blood work to confirm. While my diet is a bit heavy in carbs, I do eat a fair amount of protein, or at least I thought so. I am a moderate milk producer, making about 1.3 L a day. My doctor recommended I try to get more protein in my diet, take some riboflavin and coQ10, and get my blood drawn to verify her hypothesis. I'm keenly awaiting the results.


When I told my doctor that the way I'm feeling makes me want to switch to formula, she was really encouraging of doing so. ""Your health is important! Formula is just fine!"", She said. 


So I decided to stop pumping this week (except I woke up with aching breasts and had to pump to relieve some pressure) and we'll gradually transition to formula over the next few weeks. I have about 8 L stored in the freezer so if we combo feed it should last a little while. 


I'm looking forward to feeling normal again but I am a little emotional about not breastfeeding anymore. I do like the bonding and seeing his little face looking at me while he eats. Plus breastfeeding is a sure way to get him to sleep.  But I just don't feel like it's healthy for me and I think baby will do just fine with formula. Lots of mixed emotions today.",beyondthebump

We are down to 4 bottles a day, 6-7 ounces each. Baby girl used to be a champ bottle drinker. She would try to gobble up to the very the last drop. I would have to pace feed her because she wanted to drink it fast.

About a month ago she started exploring the nipple and would poke it with her finger lol. But it was fine because she was still drinking.

But, NOW, oh my gosh. She’ll drink maybe an ounce at a time and then want to sit up and wave her arms around. I give her some time and let her get back to. But most times now she will smack the bottle away. She is hungry because it’s like 3.5-4 hours after her first bottle (and about 2 hours after her meal). Eventually she will drink the whole thing but it takes forever. I increased her nipple size to see if that helps but it only helped for about a day.

And she looks at her and says OHHHH DID THE WITTLE BABY POOP and keep bouncing her. She’ll then continue to cry and say is she hungry and i say yeah probably! She has made countless remarks like you need to start pumping so i can bottle feed her. Like no i will literally never pump while you’re in the picture because you piss me off so much? She also was against breastfeeding my whole pregnancy and always made comments about how it was weird and how her son was formula fed and he is just fine! She also makes comments to my DD like “tell your mama to get you a bottle so i can actually hold you!” They are just so overbearing and i despise them sorry not sorry. But i tell my husband when she starts crying in their arms you shouldn’t just sit there and allow it like either take her back and soothe her or hand her to me and I’ll do it! The same thing just occurred with his grandma. She held her for 20 minutes and she was perfect (which honestly gave me terrible anxiety) then she started intermittent crying and she just sat on the couch bouncing her , him sitting right next to her like tickling her feet saying it’s okay! And eventually i had enough and said i think she’s getting tired!

Please someone sympathize with me and teach e how to have a damn backbone and just walk over there and snatch my baby up.

First of all, I’m not yet a parent, just here looking for some guidance and wisdom from those of you who are please. 💜

I’m 33f and have never thought I’d have children. I just don’t feel the maternal urge for them, and while I enjoy playing with other people’s kids, I’ve never been particularly interested in raising a child of my own.

Fast forward to today, and I’ve fallen really deeply in love with a man who wants to be a father. So, for possibly the first legitimate time, I’m letting myself consider what it might be like to bring a kid or kids into the world.

My own parents marriage was pretty dysfunctional, as a result I can’t say I’ve got the best models for how being parents can be great. To be honest, the thing I think I’m most scared of is to have a child, and then the stress and pressure of it all to destroy my relationship with the child’s father.

So, if you’re willing to share, I’d love to hear your stories of how becoming parents actually deepened or strengthened the bond between you and your spouse!

Went to the GP and derm. Got bloodwork that came back normal. Derm says it’s probably just postpartum hairloss and gave me some steroid to put on my scalp.

I have lost SO MUCH hair. My son will be 4 months on the 22nd but I’m not exaggerating—I have lost at least half of my hair. My part has widened. I can see scalp I’ve never been able to see before. I’m really trying not to panic but I feel like this can’t be normal.

164,Help me brainstorm “easy” meals for toddler after new baby is born,"38 weeks today with baby #2.  This week I plan to stock up on some  easy dinners to prepare for our toddler for after the baby is born. We will fortunately have some family members providing dinners the first couple of weeks, but I want to have some back up options in case our toddler does not like what they bring. He is not very picky but I’d rather have some “back up” meals for him just in case I am not feeling up to cooking and he doesn’t like whatever leftovers we have from our family members. 

The problem is that we are the type of family that either eats a full-on home cooked meal or we eat out/ do DoorDash and there’s no in between. I am not well-versed in the best brands of microwaveable/freezer meal type of foods but am willing to buy some things like that since I will not feel like cooking homemade meals for us for a couple weeks and will rely on the meals our families bring us. I know about the make-ahead freezer meal option but I don’t know if I have the energy and patience for all that at this point in the game. Haha. 

So… what are some brands with good, low effort microwaveable or frozen food options?  He will probably be eating a lot of sandwiches, soup, yogurt, fruits, cucumbers, etc for lunches but I’d like something a little more “warm and filling” for him for dinners. 

Any ideas?",beyondthebump

168,How much noise can a baby sleep through? (Noisy Neighbours),"I posted on a DIY group here about soundproofing the nursery windows due to noise from the kids on the street. Quite a few people replied that I shouldn't worry and the baby will sleep through it.

However...it really isn't just normal kids playing. 

Several neighbours have complained and one friend on the street has called them feral. They've walked into her house before when she left the door open to bring in shopping, put stones on the tyres of her car, ring her doorbell repeatedly and run past her kitchen window (on her driveway) screaming. (The kids are aged 4-13ish)

I live on a small road of 13 houses. It's a dead end little road so it's just used as one big drive by the children. 3 of the houses in the middle each have about 4-5 children and they all come out in one huge group. 

I live in the end house. For some reason - maybe because it's away from their parents - they all like to gather here, right by my drive / car. The nursery window overlooks the drive. 

They have a quad bike with an air horn, a basketball that they slam into the end fence (1m away from the nursery window) and they hold races with this end fence as the finishing line, so they're all screaming and shouting and slapping the fence when they get there. 

They're out until 9-10pm, honking horns, screaming / shouting, dunking the basketball into a portable hoop that sounds like a gun being fired every time it's hit. They had a birthday party last week and were out on the street stomping on the balloons to pop them until 10:30pm.

Will a baby sleep through this?? Until what age? Won't she become more aware and bothered by the noise as she gets older? 

I've sat in the nursery with them all a few metres away outside, screaming, and it was awful. She's heard them from our top bedroom and been woken a few times by the sudden screaming. 

I've spoken to the kids several times, spoken to the parents. There's not much else I can do. We've had the house valued as we're considering all options, even moving.

Baby girl is teething (6mo). Her bottom teeth have erupted, but I can tell she's still in a lot of pain. I'm just wondering what can I do to help? She tends to throw damp or cold washcloth away from her, and she tends to drool out any kind of orajel really quick. I feel like I've been giving her too much Tylenol considering how young she is.

176,Fed up.,"I have a 5 year old &amp; a 5 month old. When older child was a baby, DH did help a lot but he had bad judgement…when I tried to get some rest, he’d fall asleep with baby and drop him or sleep through cries when baby was in crib. 

Now with new baby, I’ve been reluctant letting DH “help” especially finding him passed out with baby in an unsafe way again! He can’t stay awake, day or night. He has not once gotten up with this baby because it takes me shaking the shit out of him to wake up and then takes him forever to get up, so I just do it. He sleeps 8+ consecutive hours a night. I haven’t slept more than 3 straight since the baby was born. 

He has the freedom to do what he pleases, wakes up when he wants to and go out without worrying about childcare. If I need or want to do something I have to figure out what to do with the kids because he has no clue what to do with the baby.

He went on a bachelor party this weekend 4 hours away, told me how nice it was to get away and how great it was to catch up on some sleep…since he had to wake up extra early all week for work last week. He knows I barely get to sleep so very insensitive to say.

I can’t say anything because “all he does is feel guilty”. And how he tries to help but I won’t let him. Well, I would if I could trust him not to fall asleep! We got into a fight last week when the baby was sick and up every hour (as was I), and he yelled that he was tired too and had been up since 4am and I yelled back that I’d been up since last March. 

I know this doesn’t last forever but a lot of resentment is building up. My mom helps when I work (from home) some days.

179,Growing into Motherhood as a Trans Woman,"Truthfully, I’m not entirely sure if this belongs here. I’m not entirely sure where to turn to because I am not a part of any circle where children and families are a thing. I am a little lost on where to begin and that terrifies me. Recently, my partner and I found out the impossible—we’re going to have a baby. I don’t want to get into my life story on here but what’s important to know is that I am a trans woman who stopped taking hormones so my partner and I could have a chance at having a baby of our own. 

When I was younger, I never imagined I’d get here and it doesn’t feel real until you see the positive pregnancy sign or when the blood work comes back and everything is elevated because there is now something growing inside my partner that we made together. I don’t think I’ve ever received news that completely stopped me knowing that the life I once knew is over. I am no longer a young 20-something thinking of only themselves but now a 30 year old who is accountable for not just one, but two individuals who depend on me in everyday life. 

Perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself but suddenly it’s as though everything I want to do is to give my baby the best future possible, to bring joy and love and happiness into their lives. I think we can all agree that regardless of how we identify, we all want the same for our families and our children. I suppose what I’m asking is where do I begin? How can I better prepare myself for the next 9 months and beyond? I know this isn’t a simple answer.

He refuses everything lol 

His pediatrician says he may have trouble swallowing, so put in a referral for him to see a speech therapist so we can at least rule that out. She said she's not entirely concerned given his age and we may need to explore different options once he's 12 months but...

Has anyone had their baby start eating a little later than most?

My husband is such a natural super dad and takes charge with the baby because the baby just cries and screams with me.

For me, it doesn’t feel natural and is a daily struggle as I am unsuccessful in any attempt to meet baby’s needs. He is just always angry and upset with me, especially when trying to soothe him during a fussy moment. He just gets more worked up to the point where my husband needs to intervene. 

My confidence as a mom is just shredded every time. I’m tired of advice like “baby feels your anxious energy which is why he doesn’t like being with you” or “are you trying (insert unsolicited advice here)?” or “you should be thankful that your husband does it all; mine doesn’t do anything with our kids!”

196,3.5 months old won’t drink enough,"After our last appointment with the pediatrician, she recommended we up our LO’s feeding so he might sleep through the night. She recommended 5 feedings of 180 ml (6oz) instead of 7 feedings at about 120 ml (4oz). I say about 120 ml because I’m not sure as I was breastfeeding. 

My maternity leave ended 2 weeks ago so now our LO gets bottled pumped milk during the day. He is used to the bottle as we always gave him pumped breastmilk in the night since birth so that my mom could help out with nightfeedings. 

I think the combination of me not being around him all day anymore and exclusively getting a bottle instead of a breast, made him not as hungry as before. We can’t get him to eat more than 3 or 4 oz (even less than before!). Some days he refuses multiple feedings and doesn’t feed for 6 hours straight. 

Luckily he has some some reserves, at 7,5 kg (16,5 lbs) he was always somewhere in the 90th percentile. But we can’t do this longterm right? He is still very active and awake but poops a lot less (before 1-3 times a day, now once every 2 days).

Our LO has always been a difficult sleeper (naps) but at least he always fed very well. Now he doesn’t eat or sleeps well and I can’t help but feel like we’re doing something wrong.
The days I’m not working he feeds without a problem and takes frequent (contact)naps. Since birth he has always been very attached to me so maybe that is part of the problem?

My dad recently visited and stayed with us for a month and WOW, it was amazing to have someone else watch the baby, be able to spend alone time with my husband, and have someone else help with cooking and cleaning. I’m missing the extra set of hands. 

Not gonna lie, I get jealous of my friends who have family help. Especially my friends who recently gave birth. When I tell them how postpartum is I say how tiring/stressful/crazy it is. But then when I ask them how things are they are doing great because they have help from in laws etc. We want to have another baby eventually but I don’t even know how we’ll be able to handle it without extra support. When things get stressful I always wonder how single parents do it (shoutout to them!! As well as SAHMs, a job I could never do). 

Anyway just wanted to vent about this as I am laying sick in bed and dreading for my daughter to wake up the moment I close my eyes (as she has been for the past few days!)",beyondthebump

203,Cutting baby's hair before 1,"Hey moms. Just wanna ask, has anyone tried cutting their babies' hair before they turn 1 year old? My baby's hair is already poking his eyes and we're really tempted to trim it but we were told we're not allowed to cut it yet until he's a year old. I'm not sure if it's just a myth or if there's actually a scientific explanation.

204,Baby torticollis jaw asymmetry,"So my 3 months old is diagnosed with torticollis. We are doing the home stretching exercises, tummy time and the football carry as instructed by PT. I think I see the tilt improving but the jaw misalignment is still the same. PT said the exercises are for the neck, and the jaw issue should be seen by a pediatrician.

I am thinking maybe we need to try purees so he learns to swallow first? Or just keep trying by going straight to solid real foods?",beyondthebump

Cysts, IBS,  headaches, adhd, birth control, iron deficiency anemia, psoriasis patches, and a skin bump issue that’s worst in the armpits and usually from too much weight and estrogen. I’m only 10 pounds above normal weight and 5 months post. In many many ways I am better at this point than my first pregnancy but all these things are compounding.

209,Nanit Experiences/Accuracy?,"So we were feeling pretty good about our baby sleeping through the night… until now. Typically I get a bunch of “baby woke up/baby fell asleep” insights, but they never have any video at all so I assumed they weren’t accurate. I have it going in the background all night and don’t hear anything. 

With that said, the Nanit finally captured a video from last night that said “baby woke up” and it does, in fact, look like she woke up from the video and we missed it. What’s weird is that I know I was up at the time so I’m shocked I didn’t hear anything. But now I’m questioning whether all of the baby woke up insights I see without video (“oops! We were unable to generate a clip for this event”) are actually accurate. I have no way of knowing without any video to review, but I feel awful that my daughter is potentially waking up multiple times a night and we are failing to respond to her. We do have a tower AC going at night so there is a lot of white noise— but when she cries, we hear it. Or at least I thought we did. :( 

In your experience, are these insights accurate even without video? Or are they possible false alarms? I feel so guilty and am afraid to fall asleep now!",beyondthebump
210,In My Mom Feels,"So. Much. Mom. Guilt. 

Guilt. That's what I felt. I took a real shower today. And I took my time. I spent more than 30 seconds washing my hair and I actually let the conditioner sit while I shaved my legs and trimmed my neglected lady garden. I scrubbed my feet and exfoliated my face. Applied lotion and let the music drown out any possible noise from the rest of the house. I let my mind go blank while the water washed away all the spit up, milk that had leaked, the two day old make-up, the sticky feeling of a body that overheats because hormones are crazy. 

I took my time. 

I brushed my teeth and detangled my hair. I completely dried off before trying to put on clothes. I sang along and bobbed my head to the music. 

I took my time. 

I was so refreshed; thankful, really. I was grateful for the time to feel like a human again. I was happy to not be needed for an uninterrupted 30 minutes. I was relieved knowing I didn't have to uncomfortably express every last drop of milk. 

And then....I felt guilt. It rushed over me like an unexpected wave in the ocean that hits you from behind. It crushed me like an anvil. It swallowed every ounce of peace that had filled my body. 

That time could've been used snuggling my baby. I could've been pumping to try to boost the little supply that I have. I could've been doing the laundry or the dishes or making lunch or vacuuming. 

These things can pile up for a few days...I know that. But my brain won't let it. I always feels like I have to go, go, go. That if I'm not keeping up with daily chores or making sure I'm at pace with her growing appetite...then I'm not doing enough. You want to do everything but have the energy to do nothing. 

You want to do it all to the best of your abilities. You want to be the best mom. You want to take the best care of your baby. You want to make sure everyone is happy and healthy. 

But man, the guilt when you try to take care of yourself. It's a hard balance to find; fulfilling everyone else's needs and your own. It comes eventually...but not today. And that's okay because you'll still wake up tomorrow and do it all over again.",beyondthebump
211,Is it bad to let my baby play at night?,"Recently my daughter has been waking up after bedtime and this is not normal for her, I try to do everything to get her back to sleep but she just won’t.

Is this wrong for me to let her do this?",beyondthebump
212,Anyone else’s baby/toddler’s shoulders pop and click when they cry?,"So I’ve read online that clicking and popping is normal when you pick them up, they fall, etc… but when she’s really wailing, they pop and click with every deep breath and wail she lets out. It’s not her lungs, I can physically feel her shoulders popping and clicking on my fingers when I place my hand on her back and she is crying. Any one else’s child do this? 

Ps: She is 15 months old. Her aunt on her father’s side has EDS. Don’t know if it’s hereditary or not.",beyondthebump
213,It's hard.,"Being a mom is H.A.R.D. 

Plain and simple. No other words needed. 

We're needed 24/7. At least that's how it feels. Especially for new moms. Moms that haven't quite got a routine and are still figuring out what works best for their baby...and themselves. Moms who read all the blogs during pregnancy; tips and tricks for making the mom life ""easier"", just to find that those things don't apply to their baby. 

Feed. Sleep. Tummy Time. 

It sounds SO simple to anyone without a child. How hard could it really be to take care of a newborn? They don't roll. They don't speak. They sleep a lot. 

Sure. That's true. 

But every 2-3 hours that baby is wanting to eat. Eight to twelve, sometimes more, times a day...you're pulling out a boob, pumping into a bottle or mixing powder. Doesn't sound like much. But sometimes those nursing sessions last 45 minutes (an hour to two until the next one), or the formula didn't set right and your baby is gassy and spitting up, or maybe you barely pumped an ounce and a half and you know your baby is going to be hungry way before two hours has passed. 

And then add in the diapers. SO. MANY. DIAPERS...and wipes. You take off a diaper, just for her to pee before the next diaper is ready. You wipe the poo, just for her to start pooing again as soon as you snap the third button on the bottom of a onesie worn by a wiggling baby. You successfully change a diaper, make it out the nursery door, and sit on the couch just to instantly feel the vibration of ANOTHER poo filling her diaper. That's 5-20 minutes. 

That leaves you with 1 - 1 1/2 hours before she wants to eat again. Plenty of time, right? 

Do I shower? Do I eat and fill my water bottle? Do I wash all the pump parts and bottle pieces that have accumulated? Do I make the bed? Do I finish the laundry? Do I do the dishes? Do I let out the dogs? Do I check the mail? Do I feed the cats? Do I vacuum? Do I catch up on my show? Do I update her baby book? Do I reasearch baby milestones, sleep schedules and feeding habits? Or do I do nothing so I can recharge my battery? 

What do I do? 

You finally decide and so much time has already passed. Now you have an hour or less to prioritize your list. What's most important? Baby related chores. Those are most important. I'll take care of myself later. 

I wash the pieces, maybe a few dishes while I'm at it. I still have a bit of time, she's not squirming in her sleep yet. I'll clean my face and start some coffee, maybe grab a snack bar. The caffeine gurgles in the machine, I toss the face wipe in the trash. 

Crying. 

She's awake and, boy, she's hungry. The mug is empty, pumping and bottle supplies are soaking...cries are intensifying. 

An hour has passed, but she's fed with a fresh diaper and she's drifting back to sleep on my chest. 

Do I dare move her to the crib? Do I sit here and relax? Do I gently finish chores one-handed while she's cradled in the other arm? 

She's pooping in her sleep. Do I risk laying her down to change her diaper? Do I let her sleep just a little longer because she just stopped crying and mom is tired? Don't have it in me to just let her sit in a dirty diaper. 

She's crying again....hungry again. Formula makes me sad but my nipples feel like shredded flesh and there's no time to pump. What do I do? I sacrifice. If it appeases her until I can pump or mix a bottle, I'll do it. It hurts. Excruciating, really. But I do it...she's hungry...and three hours has passed 

I'll drink my cold coffee and try to work in tummy time sometime in the next three hours.",beyondthebump
214,"Exposed LO to prolonged, loud white noise for weeks… feeling guilty that I’ve damaged my baby.","I feel like a horrible father. My LO is 6 weeks old and we’ve been using a portable speaker in his crib to play white noise at a high volume whenever he sleeps since pretty much his birth. I read somewhere that the baby will sleep best with white noise at a volume of a vacuum or blow dryer. Supposedly it’s that loud in the womb. 

My wife questioned if it was too loud early on but convinced her that it is what was recommended. 

My MIL just questioned it today and my wife looked it up and we’ve now learned that this practice is dangerous and could cause hearing damage.

We tested the volume of the approximate volume we’ve used and I feel confident that I’ve put it around 80-85 decibels (can’t tell for sure) regularly for prolonged periods which is in the dangerous range for volume. 

I’m having a hard time with living with myself today. I’m the calm, collected parent who usually does the appropriate research before making any rash decisions. I can’t believe I’ve endangered my son with such neglect and counter-safety practice. Reflecting on this as I type it out brings me guilt and shame. 

We’re calling to schedule a hearing test on Monday to see. In the meantime, I’m hoping some parents have some experience or knowledge with noise-induced hearing loss.",beyondthebump

I mentioned how much pain I was in before I was discharged and they said it was normal and I’d feel better in a week. The doctor who delivered my baby told the other OB that I had a “vagina explosion” and I have a follow up appointment on Wednesday with her. I have the ice packs, Tucks, and spray but it all seems very ineffective. I had no idea I’d be in this much pain and this useless.

219,6 month old had puss on his privates?? What do you think?,"My son is 6 months old, his penis has been on the smaller side since he was born. It was normal at first, but after I got him circumcized it stays tucked in? Anyways, I have to clean it as if it was uncircumcised, its a 'turtle' as his pediatrician calls it, lol. It has had smegma and his pediatrician said to just clean it whenever I change his diaper and kind of push his penis out with my 2 fingers to encourage the excess foreskin to pull away from the head of his penis. Well, earlier when I did that i noticed a yellowish/light green puss that I have not seen before. It seemed almost watery, like puss from a pimple. ((I know, gross.)) I cleaned it off, and he started crying like it was hurting him. Its foul smelling, almost like fishy. Its obviously very concerning, it didnt look like it was coming from anything, but it was hurting him and I dont think it's normal. 
He is my first, his father isnt around so I asked the only boy I have around, my dad and he said to just wait and see. His pediatricians office isn't open until monday, and im just kind of freaking out.

227,Are you letting your children around unvaccinated adults?,"Just an opinion question here. I have a six month old and we spend lots of time as a family with her aunts and uncles, grandparents, and cousins. All of the adults that she has come into contact with since the vaccine became widely available have been vaccinated. 

My very best childhood friend lives 15 minutes from me and has only met my daughter once. She and her husband are choosing not to get the vaccine because they are concerned about potential long-term side effects. That’s fine. I completely respect their right to choose what to do with their bodies. But, I don’t feel comfortable having them around my baby. They have a greater risk of contracting and transmitting Covid. 

My best friend is taking this very personally, since she knows my baby has been around our other friends and family. She believes that with the Delta variant, vaccinated people are as likely to get and spread Covid than the unvaccinated. She says that she and her husband are both very careful in their personal lives not to contract Covid and that being around them would be perfectly safe. She says she knows many parents and none of them are is being as strict.

In October we are having a baby naming ceremony for our daughter. This typically happens within a few weeks of the baby’s birth, but obviously due to the pandemic we didn’t want to have any gatherings at that time. She and her whole family are invited, but I have made it very clear on the invitation that only vaccinated people should attend and anyone who has not received a vaccine by the time of the party can tune into the live stream. Of course I feel terrible that I’ve invited her whole family, who are vaccinated, and they will likely be able to come but she and her husband can not! It’s a terrible situation and I hate having to exclude her in this way. I just don’t want my baby to be around anyone who is able to receive the vaccine and has not. She says if I’m so concerned about risk than I shouldn’t have a gathering at all. I can’t make the risk zero, but I can try to keep it as low as possible. There will also be other high risk guests and I want to keep them safe as well.

Any suggestions? It's been smooth sailing until this week then bam.",beyondthebump

248,Husband Consistently Blames Me,"So, I just want to preface this by saying 90% of the time I have an absolutely wonderful spouse. However, he has this infuriating behavior of deflecting responsibility back to me. 

Example: We make smoothies for our 15 month old and give them to her in her sippy cup. This morning, I slept in so I missed breakfast and snack time. When it was my shift to watch her so my husband could attend a class, she had pulled a sippy cup from under the couch and I noticed there was another cup with water on the coffee table that I assumed was from this morning. So, I took the sippy cup she had and realized it had smoothie in it. 

I called my husband quick just to see if he had given it to her that morning and he said the last time she had a smoothie was Thursday. Yuck. I said, ""Okay, please be more mindful of making sure her smoothie cups get into the sink when she's finished."" Now, I understand when you're watching a toddler it can be chaos and toys get everywhere. It's an easy mistake to make and miss that it got pushed under the couch. His response, ""Yeah, YOU and I need to be better about that."" Umm.... no.. HE does! All I needed was a, ""Oops! Oh yeah, of course I'll pay more attention."" It ended in me unloading on him which now leaves me in a whirlwind of guilt and frustration. 

Something so stupid and easily resolved has me absolutely FUMING and burning with resentment. I don't know how to make him understand how damaging this behavior is. I've brought it up multiple times and even his mother calls him out on it.",beyondthebump
249,How to dry up milk?,"Please dont suggest cabbages!! I've already tried that and unfortunately they seem to 1) not help at all and 2) smell 3) because they can not soak up my constant leakage I was constantly covered in breastmilk.

My left boob, which has always been the weaker boob is doing fine with me pumping less and less (as in not pumping as long nor as frequent) however my right boob has been KILLING me.

250,6 month sleep regression?,"My daughter just turned 6 months old. For the last two weeks ish on a few nights she has woken up around 3 am to play? Lol. She’s refreshed and babbling away for an hour in the middle of the night. Then last night, she went to bed at her normal time around 8:30. At 11:30pm she woke for a feed which is normal. BUT she wouldn’t go back to sleep. She was smiling and babbling. She would seemingly fall asleep and I would put her in the crib. Then she would wake up 10min later rolled over and smiling 😩😩🥺🥺 So she babbled and rolled until 1:30am!!!!!!!!!!!


Recently she’s been babbling a lot more and rolling like crazyyyyyy. So I’m wondering if this is the 6 month regression and she’s just practicing her new skills hahaha 



For context, I keep her routine very strict regardless of disruptions. The nights she wakes up like this, she ends up waking up at 9/9:30am instead of her usual 7-8:30am. But she still takes her three naps (in the wrap and that’s perfectly okay with me). And she’s in bed by 8/8:30pm depending on her last nap.",beyondthebump

Anyone else who never had cramps, do you feel like your labour was less painful than you expected?

253,Back to work and my heart might actually be breaking,"Y’all… I was not mentally prepared for how much this would hurt. Please share any encouraging thoughts to help reassure me I’m not fucking up here. My mom guilt is so real right now. 

I am a nurse and go back to work in two days. My son is 9.5 months old and I’m so grateful I’ve been able to spend such a long stretch of time with him at home. Thankfully my husband can provide for us financially, and with covid I hadn’t found a job until recently that I felt comfortable with now that I have an infant at home. 

I have been so excited to get back to my career, have exchanges with other adults, and make money again. We move a lot due to my husbands job so currently we live in a city where I literally don’t know a single soul (again, covid and social distancing). It’s been equal parts rewarding and isolating/lonely to be at home the last 10 months with my son. 

This past month I found the perfect job that will offer me flexible hours after my initial training, but two weeks ago my husband temporarily moved 9 hours away for work and will be gone the rest of the year. I couldn’t find a single vaccinated nanny to watch my son while I work. So he will be staying at my parents house 3 hours away for 3-4 days at a time while I work my three 12 hour shifts back to back each week. I’ll be with him in between my workdays. 

HOW do I cope with this?! I feel like I’m going to miss so much. I know it’s the right move to protect him pandemic-wise, but boy I’m feeling like a shit mom right now for giving up this time with him to pursue my career.",beyondthebump

259,My Serenity Kids A2 Toddler Formula,"Hi everyone! I am going to begin supplementing a little formula into my 7 month olds diet. I still intended to feed primarily breast milk, but need to get some extra calories in her as her weight gain is *slightly* slowing down. 

There is a new formula on the market- My Serenity Kids A2 Toddler Formula. I am very interested in this option due to the ingredients they use. 

It is classified as a toddler formula. From my novice research it appears it is classified as toddler formula only because they have not gotten the FDA approval as an infant formula and there is not enough vitamin C. The ingredients are all approved for infant formula and they are working to be classified for infants. (Again- this is my novice research)

It seems from social media and reviews of the product, there are plenty of parents giving this product to infants with pediatrician approval. I have an appointment with our pediatrician next week and fully intend on getting their approval before using it. I am here just looking to see if any other parents are considering this product and looking for other perspectives! 

Of course fed is best!! Just looking for any input as we take the next step on our feeding journey!",beyondthebump
260,Bottle reviews,"I have tried a bunch of different bottles for my baby in the 5 weeks of his life. We feed 50/50 breastmilk/formula. I thought I’d share my experience in case anyone is looking to try out different brands. 

I was looking for:
1. Slow flow to mimic breast flow while I was still trying to breastfeed + supplement
2. Gas reduction

*TommeeTippee anti colic*
Absolute trash IMO. 

Annoying to clean, made my baby gassier than any other bottle. 

I only used for a week before throwing them in the “to donate” box 


*Nuk Simply Natural* - size 1 nipple
Love! 

Flow: is a bit faster than I’d expect from a size 1, but baby seems to like it just fine. Too fast to mimic my breast flow though. 

Nipple: pretty good, baby seems to latch fairly well. 

Also affordable.


*Comotomo* - size 1 &amp; 2 nipple
Love!

Flow: The size 1 nipple is the absolute slowest flow I’ve found. I honestly think it’s too slow for a 5 week old cause he falls asleep mid feed a lot. 

The size 2 is great for him and closer to the other bottles I have. 

Nipple: not great. I get the worst latch on this bottle. He makes a lot of smacking, clicking, sucking noises on this bottle. 

Biggest con is they’re really expensive. I found a bulk lot of them on Mercari for under 1/2 price you’d pay in the store. Only problem is I have so many now. 

Also the rounded bottom is really annoying when trying to set it down on a non flat surface like a couch. It will roll right off onto the floor. 

*Phillips Advent* size 1 nipple
They’re OK

I have them stashed away for a rainy day/day when I run out of bottles. 

Flow: is the fastest out of all bottles I have, including Comotomo size 2 nipple. Too fast for my baby, as I like to pace feed. 

Nipple: is comparable to NUK, pretty good latch. 


*MAM* Size 0 nipple
Love!

I JUST got these but they’re great so far. 

Flow: comparable to NUK (1) and Comotomo (2)

Nipple: the only one that doesn’t cause my baby to make loud smacking, clicking, and sucking sounds. He seems to latch on it well. 

My only complaint is with the venting system. It means each bottle has 5 separate parts to clean since the bottom screws off and there’s a rubber(silicone?) valve that needs to be washed too.",beyondthebump

I was wondering if anyone switched to a nanny with 2, if they found it favorable financially? Also It seems to me that being a nanny for a 3mo old and 2year old at the same time would be so hard, and that maybe it is better for their development to have them in the daycare classes.

263,6 month sleep regression? Or gas?,"So we did sleep training once my daughter went into her own crib at about 5 months and she did well. 10-11 hours - hooray! And also when she moved into her room, we started doing a nice routine of rocking to just one song before bed, which started as her going down super drowsy, but now she loves it so much she falls asleep in my arms. She’s so used to the routine that as soon as I finish a book and hold her, she lays her head down immediately. (Can’t say I hate it.)

But recently, she’s waking up 2-6 times at night, though I somehow think it’s not the rocking sleep, but gas? I thought it was the rocking, but now when I pick her up in the night, she often has a big burp come up. So, in this case, I don’t think sleep training will help, and the ‘cry it out’ would seem cruel. 

Any tips? Does anyone else’s baby wake up from gas? I then thought it could be the intro of solids, so I stopped giving her solids after 3pm. Yet she still wakes up 😑 Doc says she’s got a very low weight, so I’m trying to feed nonstop, but I can’t get her to burp everything anymore - it just doesn’t work. Also, I think she’s too used to pacifier. Ugh. She many ‘normal’ baby things. I miss my sleep.",beyondthebump

265,Yet another “my baby only sleeps on his tummy” post. Please help!,"I know this has been brought up endless times and I’m sorry for bringing it up yet another time. 

Our newborn (2 weeks) is only able to sleep on his tummy since pretty much day 1. We have tried every possible swaddle in the market but he just hates sleeping on his back, the longest we get him to sleep is 15-20 minutes. For the most part we take turns at night with him sleeping on our chest and that’s the only way baby and parents are getting any significant sleep.

I don’t know if I could read more about SIDS, it’s just overwhelming and honestly don’t know what to do. No parent wants to put their baby at risk, but isn’t a deprived baby and parents adding more risk than the potential of SIDS by tummy sleeping? 

I’m ok getting yelled at, but I would like to hear from parents whose baby only likes to tummy sleep how they overcame the fear or better yet, techniques on how to get them to sleep on their backs. Parents of babies that sleep fine on their backs don’t really understand and they usually just say “do it, for the safety of your child!” Not that easy bud.

I may not have access to a sink at my workplace. Should I store the pumping equipment inside the cooler bag and wash at home? Would that be okay in terms of bacteria growth?

I'm thinking of taking 15 minutes or so to pump using a hand pump (may not have access to a wall outlet and my electric pump doesn't run on batteries). I'll then put the pumped milk inside a cooler bag/box (please let me know what your preferred cooler bags/boxes are!) with an ice pack.

Would tummy time pillows help with the transition so baby can have longer tummy time? Or is it better to just tough it out, and have shorter sessions?

My work situation will be one of two options. 1) I'll be on call Monday - Friday nights from 9pm to 7am or 2) I'll work three 12 hour shifts during the week. That's still up in the air at the moment. My LO wakes usually 2 times in the middle of the night to eat and then is up by 830ish for the day. Pumping would obviously take place during the day if I was working but I might not be able to at night if I was called in (I'd be doing trauma cases that are very busy at night) but I think it would be okay beings he only wakes twice to feed at night. I could probably pump when I got home from a case and be okay. Also, getting called in is hit or miss depending on the night and could be an all night thing or just a couple hours, etc.

278,5 weeks postpartum - is it normal to still feel sore?,"I had a longer labour - about 30 hours total, I was 9 days overdue, partially ruptured membranes (my water broke above but my fore waters did not), stalled labour, had to be induced, epidural, pushed for 2.5 hours, baby was posterior, and had second degree tearing. The first few weeks PP I felt sore and swollen but kinda okay? I would go for walks, water my plants, vacuum etc. My stitches felt weird and annoying, like something was “stuck” in my vagina but I wrote that off as swelling etc. I dropped 25lbs in 2.5 weeks (thanks breastfeeding) and am now a little below my pre-pregnancy weight.

My stitches started to fall out / dissolve last week and since then I have noticed increased soreness in my perineum (which tore) and in general around my vagina. Aches and fatigue. When I go for walks it feels sort of like I have a tampon in, but I don’t? I checked things out with a hand mirror and it sort of looks like my vagina walls are touching each other (front and back) but nothing is “falling out”. 

I am wondering if I am dealing with prolapse or if this is normal to still feel sore and weak 5 weeks out from birth? I poop like a champ (daily) and haven’t leaked any urine. I guess I just expected to “feel normal” at this point and I am stressing that something is wrong down there and I still feel like
garbage more than a month later.

279,Advice,"My stepdaughter has recently begun showing strange signs of alarming behavior. She went to her grandparents house, for a month over summer vacation, and came back home. when she came home, we found texts in her phone showing she stayed up until 4 am “roleplaying” with friends, and texted “on the first day of school, does anyone wanna help commit mass murder?:D”, and “if we don’t have classes together I’m going to pull a switchblade on the front office”. This child is not like that. She is an honor roll student who has just been hanging around the “emo” crowd, kids who shop at hot topic etc. She has social anxiety so it’s difficult for her to make friends. 
We got her a psychiatrist that she sees every two weeks, and we took her cell phone as she’s clearly being irresponsible with it. 
We’ve asked her 1000 times if she wants to kill herself or us, anyone for that matter, and the answer has always been no. 
Lately, she’s been lying to us about EVERYTHING, no matter how small or dumb. She lies about wanting to kill herself, we found that out today because she finally told us, she lies about the things she says, she has become manipulative between my partner and I, to the point where he and I are now fighting about her. She drew a picture of herself with her throat and wrists cut, gave us some BS story and then toe us the truth. We’ve tried spending extra time with her, making her feel extra special one on one, and she’s ungrateful about it. 
I feel like I’m going crazy, and no matter how many times we talk about her attitude, or behavior, nothing changes.

283,My bedtime trick,"Just thought this might work for someone else like it has for me. I have two toddlers (3.5 and 22 months), and when my daughter was 18-20 months old I started a routine, not every night but semi frequently. The inspiration was guided savasanas at the end of yoga classes where they have you focus on the sensation your fingers, then your hands, etc, in like a relaxation process. (So not a yoga expert). 

Anyways, when my toddlers are having a hard time settling into bedtime, I will start at their hair and stroke each part of their body and give them kisses, and say in a whisper as I do so:

I love your hair. And your forehead. Your eyes and your eyebrows. I love your nose, and your chin. I love your lips and your ears. I love your shoulders and your arms and your elbows. I love your fingers and your finger nails. I love your chest and your belly. I love your belly button!* I love your back and your legs, I love your little bootie*, I love your knees and your feet. I love your toes and each of your toenails. I love, every part of you.

(*usually belly button or bootie I say in a sillier voice because toddlers think belly buttons and bottoms are funny, so they get a soft giggle out of this).

… I won’t pretend to be that mom with all the sage advice, I do a lot wrong, but I kid you not, from the outset both my kids have been mesmerized by this routine. When I started with my oldest, she just said “do it again!” Until she fell asleep. Now at 3.5 it’s rarer, but when she is tossing and turning. She will tell me to “say you love every part of me!” I just started this with my not quite 2 son and it similarly puts him in a trance.",beyondthebump

What are some other ways we can help each other directly that we can plan for?

293,Chair/container for 6+mo?,"So whenever LO is in my husbands office, she’s been sitting in her mamaroo (it ended up being an expensive chair, tho we got it 2nd hand). But she’s starting to lean over and she’ll be 6mo in a few days. Sits pretty well unassisted for a long period of time (I haven’t timed her yet but sometimes she does slump over when trying to reach for things, but I don’t think it’s due to not being able to stay seated).

So my question is what’s something I can put her in for my husbands office (compact as he doesn’t have a lot of space) that will keep her entertained but not a jumper/walker which isn’t recommended for a long period of time.",beyondthebump
294,"Need support: baby suffers from asphyxia upon delivery, afraid of long term effects","My baby was born with difficult labor, with decelerating and accelerating heartbeat beyond normal. Due to this, obgyn opts for vacuum extraction. Upon delivery, baby was not reacting and was blue, and was run to ICU for breathe support for 3-4 h. She stayed for 3 days and finally can come home. I was told that they monitored her brain activity and it was fine. They did brain echo and found lesions, but they say they also found these in other babies without negative impacts.

Today upon opening her medical data, I was so sad to find that she was categorized as having perinatal asphyxia, with very low apgar score of 2 (after 5 min increased to 6). After reading from multiple journals, I found that there is high risk of impaired cognitive and mobility development associated with perinatal asphyxia. Many papers suggested cooling, but the hospital didnt do this treatment for my baby. They ruled out HIE but no reasons explained. 

Now I am so scared.
I guess I want to hear some stories of parents with babies experiencing asphyxia, and how does it affect the child in the future. Thanks.",beyondthebump

296,Work Mandating Both Covid Vaccinations - 15 weeks,"Hi everyone,

Yesterday the hospital that I work for announced that all staff, vendors and contractors must be fully vaccinated by November 1st. I previously had Covid &amp; only got one Covid vaccine and decided to not get the second shot. My works Employee Health is making us send in proof of vaccination and requiring everyone has two vaccinations by November 1st otherwise you'll be terminated. I called Employee Health to describe my situation - I'm 15 weeks pregnant and they gave me a CDC lecture on how beneficial the vaccine is for pregnancy. They sent me articles and projecting fear onto me about chances I might be severely sick with Covid and other medical fear-inducing stats. My partner is against the vaccine spiritually and would be VERY upset if I got a vaccine with his child. I feel so torn and overwhelmed by this. I have to balance my partners beliefs, my work and financial income, and the health of my child all to worry about regarding this decision. I feel so much stress and feel pulled in so many directions. Did anyone get the vaccination pregnant? Being mandated for work?",beyondthebump

I got to watch him take his first steps through a video my husband sent me. 

I got home and my son didn’t want me. He kept going to his father. He wouldn’t even look at me. I broke down in front of our nanny, in front of my husband.

Before I have a bunch of people telling me not to sleep train my 3month old. I’m not trying to get him to sleep through the night, just to find a good regular routine that lets me eat and have any personal time. 

I have 3ish goals. That mostly are the same issue of finding a schedule.

1- Eating, he grazes at the bottle about an oz every hour and I want to have him eat more less frequently 
2- Naps , he only naps for 30-40 min at a time 4-6 times a day, I believe he won’t nap longer bc he’s hungry
3- (most important) Flipping /Shifting his Schedule, we will be going back home in 3ish weeks and will be moving 8 time zones ahead of our current one. I don’t do well for 2 weeks after we fly, I don’t expect a baby to do any better. 

I need help to make the transition as smooth as possible for the 2 of us , any tips or recommendations are welcome.",beyondthebump

I can't help but be nostalgic for my old life (working, going out, seeing friends) despite enjoying my time with my daughter, and it makes me feel a ridiculous amount of guilt. I've also found myself in a bizarre cycle -- I really miss seeing my friends, but find it overwhelming to think about them coming to my place to hang out with me, so if I can't see them on a day my husband is home from work, I don't see them at all.

They are expecting their own little one early next year and we are excited for our kids to be BFF so we’d really love to attend. So thoughts on the safety of attending this wedding with our 3/4 mo babe? Everyone invited will be vaccinated, but we will probably have to travel to attend. Either a 7 hour drive or a short flight (I’m leaning towards the drive due to covid, and making a trip of it and making breaking it up over a couple days if need be). 
Any concerns/ recommended precautions we should take? 

I’m sure things will continue to change and take shape in the next couple months so we’ll keep our minds open and alert about the ongoing corona situation. We did speak to our pediatrician last week, not about the wedding specifically but about any extra precautions we should take given the new delta variant. Pediatrician assured us that covid was still mild in infants but it is still important that adults are vaccinated and taking precautions like social distancing and masking. Since it seems like the wedding will be fairly covid-safety compliant I’m thinking it will probably be ok but want to still be as careful as possible…",beyondthebump
306,Question for moms who started a new job after maternity leave,"What made you choose the new job?

I have been interviewing for jobs this past week. Work-life balance is priority for me, as I got burned out by the long hours in my current job and the mental demands it placed on me. I also want to see my baby grow up as much as possible. Remote is also nice, and 2 out of 3 jobs I've interviewed for are guaranteed remote. In terms of salary, I would be happy as long as the offers would be within my range - the benefits (PTO, parental leave, etc) are more important to me at this point. I do wonder about starting a position with a steep learning curve, because I'm concerned about burn out. On one hand, I could go for roles that are more or less the same as what I do now - I might get bored at some point, but it might offer me the balance I crave because I won't be depleted by the end of the day. On the other hand, I could take this opportunity to shift my career direction a bit to something more unfamiliar and creative and diversify my skill set, but the risk is a steep learning curve and a lot of time and travel commitment.

308,Affordable convertable car seat for small car?,"So we already have an infant car seat that came with a travel system (Graco Snugride35). We like it but we’re thinking of going ahead and getting a second car seat so we don’t have to switch it from car to car all the time. Baby is 17lbs already, so don’t want to get another infant one that he’ll grow out of faster.

The issue is that my car is a Kia Rio, and its back seat is small. The infant seat already makes it difficult for my (5ft 10in) husband to sit in the passenger seat in front of it, because you have to push the seat forward so far.

So we need a convertible car seat that fits in as small a space as possible. It seems like a lot of them are made for large vehicles and won’t fit in a compact car at all.

Pediatrician has us doing the Hemoccult tests for blood and I have cut out all dairy for a week. I have a few questions:

1) how long does it take for the dairy to clear out/occasional blood to stop? She maybe has very minimal visible blood 1 diaper a day.

Or just buy a reusable one? I don't want to be stressed when our end of summer beach vacation rolls around and I can't find any.

2. LO sleeps on a floor bed at home. I know that hotels will provide cribs, but there is no way my big, athletic 20 month old is going to take that (I'm scared they would climb out and hurt themselves in the process). Has anyone ever asked a hotel (or Airbnb) to put a mattress on the floor? I guess I could just do it myself without asking and then put it back when we check out. I don't really see why it would be a problem, but I'm the type of person who hates getting in trouble and I don't want housekeeping to come in and be like ""why tf is this mattress on the floor!?""

My poor husband was stood there watching my skin go grey and his little boy being worked on to get his lungs clear. No wonder he's banned me from having any more!

328,Are we bad parents? Can’t trust our pediatrician? Both?,"First-time dad here so please excuse the dire panicky tone in my voice. Baby girl is two weeks old today (Friday), and for the last week we’ve really gotten into a groove — feeding 2-2.5oz every three hours, putting her down for dedicated naps in her bassinet a couple times a day, getting into a good routine.

For reference: she’s averaging 12.5-15.5oz per day (mix of pumped breast milk and formula) across 8-9 feedings, and 8-10 diaper changes a day (usually 6-7 mixed and 1-3 wet only).

She was born at 6lb 1oz. When we were discharged on 8/1, she was down to 5lb 12oz. 

Yesterday, we had an appt. with her pediatrician and they weighed her — 5lb 15.2oz, meaning she’s gained 3.2oz in 11 days since discharge and is just 1.8oz from birth weight. The pediatrician said she gained no weight in the last week but that’s not true … last week they weighed her with a full diaper and yesterday, they took the diaper completely off. 

So pediatrician recommends now waking her every 1.5-2 hours and feeding her 2-2.5oz, even if she isn’t acting hungry. We took the advice and got about 12 hours into it before we realized it felt like it was a huge mistake. Our completely healthy and happy, well-sleeping baby girl was now not sleeping for a minute (combined probably got 30 mins sleep last night), seemingly uncomfortable (lots of gas/poops), and having to choke down the bottle. We’re concerned it’s really messed with her stomach to basically start doubling her intake with no ramp up whatsoever. 

Are we bad parents for being frustrated with the pediatrician’s advice and wanting to return to our previous routine? She was doing so well but the last 16 hours have been a complete nightmare.",beyondthebump

332,My not-so fun birth story…will I ever want to give birth again?,"Bear with me…it’s a long one. 

I am and FTM and was 41+2 when I gave birth. I went into the hospital at 41+1 to begin my induction over two days. The first day I was to receive cervidil to make my cervix favourable, then to receive pitocin on the second day. When I received cervidil, the OB told me that it wouldn’t put me into labour…buuuut it did. 

Driving home from the hospital I had contractions that were a minute apart lasting about 45 seconds. This was at 1pm. I called my midwives, which they had suggested that it was normal and just the cervidil working and told me to continue heading home. They said to take gravol and Tylenol and to try and take a nap, but if I wasn’t coping to call back to discuss pain management. 

At 4:00 I called the midwives because the contractions continued and I couldn’t handle the pain anymore. They brought me into the hospital to check me and to discuss pain management. I was only 1-2cm dilated (which I had been 1cm for the last 3 weeks). They gave me a shot of morphine and gravol and sent me home. They suggested I take a hot shower and try and sleep. We got home around 8pm. The morphine definitely helped and I felt more at ease. 

At 9:30 I took a hot shower. When I got out and started to put my pjs on, my water broke. My hubby called my midwives to inform them, which they had asked if I was having contractions. Due to having morphine, I couldn’t tell if I was or not; just had some cramping. They told me to stay home and that we would go with the original plan of continuing the induction the following morning. They told me to only page back if my 
Contractions were AT LEAST a minute long and less than 5 min apart. 

At 11pm I started having contractions, but they were still only about 45 seconds long, a minute apart. By 12:30 I couldn’t handle the pain anymore (it was a solid 14/10 pain). They were only lasting 55seconds to 1:02 long. I said “fuck it” and called the midwives again. They decided to bring me back in. 

1am were heading to the car to head to the hospital and I have the urge to push. I couldn’t get down the stairs without needing to cross my legs. We fly to the hospital with a handful of loud screams and pushes along the way. I thought that baby was coming on the highway. 

1:30 we arrive and I’m 9cm dilated. No time for an epidural. Worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I delivered my beautiful baby boy while sitting on a squat chair at 4:15am.

336,Positive Isolation Experience (0-6 months),"Coming up on nine months postpartum and I feel like enough time has passed that I can now say this.

I had a very isolated pregnancy and postpartum experience, and I enjoyed it.

Other than two family lunches, two visits from a close friend, and two baby playdates, we did not socialize and accepted no visitors.  I almost never left home except for groceries and medical appointments.  Both our families were on a strict info diet with minimal contact and no say whatsoever in our pregnancy and parenting decisions (and they understood that they would be cut off if they pushed boundaries).  When my parental leave ended I worked from home with our baby for a while until we found a part-time nanny we liked.

338,How can we make night nurse support compatible with breastfeeding?,"I'm curious if/how others have been able to successfully breastfeed while also getting support from night nurses.

Background: baby #2 is on the way and my husband and I are considering hiring a night nurse for a few nights a week. I struggled badly with anxiety and depression after baby #1 and getting a full night's sleep was a critical part of restoring my mental health. I was prescribed medication to help me sleep through the night, but as I was neither pumping nor nursing at night, my supply never really caught up. Breastfeeding became a real struggle and we had to give up after about two months.

I don't regret giving up breastfeeding for my mental health - fed is best and we have a healthy toddler with a healthy mom. That said, I feel more confident about breastfeeding this time around and want to give it a go. I'm worried that if I do anything other than exclusive breastfeeding at night (if I have a night nurse feed the baby while I sleep), that breastfeeding will fail. I've heard that a night nurse might watch the baby and just bring them to you to nurse before taking back over, but if you're still waking up to nurse is it even worth the cost to hire a night nurse? Are there good, middle road options that allow you to sleep without hampering your supply?",beyondthebump
339,Is it OK for me to become a SAHM?,"Hi, I am a FTM of a 15 week old. This subreddit has been my haven since I became a mom and I'm hoping you kind mamas and dadas can give me some inputs on this crossroads that I'm in.

I'm feeling really really upset and confused about working. I never thought I would go through this. I am a computer science major that graduated in the near top of my class, did my PhD, worked in tech earning a very handsome salary. Took a maternity leave for my delivery and now I feel so upset about returning and more than anything else, I feel so upset that I FEEL THIS WAY. 

Since I am a researcher/software engineer, I dont need to go into work. I can WFH. But work is EXTREMELY demanding. I need to be \*completely focused\* during the workday - which means we need to hire a nanny to look after my baby for 8-10 hours a day (husband also has a job similar to mine and strongly recommends the nanny option as its very very hard for either of us to really do anything else during the workday). Which means I cant spend any time connecting with my baby or appreciating him /loving him for over 40% of the day (and hes already growing so quickly every day!)

We are fortunate enough that if I wanted to quit, we can still manage the household expenses on my husband's salary. Plus even hire some occasional help for cleaning if needed.

But I'm so torn. I have been studying/working on things that I LOVE my whole life. Everyone expects me to do this amazing balancing act and continue achieving great things in my career. Dont get me wrong, I still love tech/software engineering and the research work that I do. I absolutely love WORKING. In-fact, I was planning start a small company next year based on some of my ideas. But its like suddenly everything has changed. I feel this unimaginable need to spend every single moment with my baby and everything seems like an obstacle in the way. 

Will I regret it in the future if I give up my tech career to become a SAHM? Is this a feeding that fades away in some time? Or will I be filled with regret if I miss this time w/ my baby when I could have shared all his precious smiles and giggles and shaped his early childhood?

343,Is your baby refusing to eat? There might be a simple reason and solution.,"I realise the title sounds like an ad but that’s not my intention. My wife and I had a very stressful time with our LO for the first 8-9 months after his birth. He was refusing to eat, would push away the bottle, would refuse breastfeeding. It would take an hour (1 person feeding, and 1 or 2 people distracting him) to get a meal down him. Every meal time was extremely stressful and we went through it about 7 times a day. We even fed him while he was asleep (which was not the right thing to do). 

If you’re having problems like this, your baby may have a feeding aversion. Someone helped us with this problem and we are really enjoying being parents now, so I just want to pass on the kindness to others. If you are going out of your mind because your baby won’t eat, please feel free to DM me and I’ll tell you how we fixed it.

344,My Son Goes to Bed Smiling,"&amp; I just realized it. My son is 19 months old and for the last week he's been going to bed with a huge smile but up until now I never realized it because I was always waiting for the shoe to drop. There have been so many nights of putting him in his crib only to hear him cry out for me while I leave, never for long, but even just a second is enough to make my heart ache. We co-slept for 10 months and every night I read threads about how it was going to be damaging, he'd never grow out of it, he'll never sleep on his own. 

We decided to try the Ferber method just before I was due to go back to work after weeks of comment threads and recommended books.  It took about a week, but sleep training stuck. I had to sit with my headphones cranked, while tears spilled down both of our faces and dad did the check-ins but it stuck. He's been sleeping through the night for 10 months now and I know that's what most people dream of but I still felt bad and couldn't figure out why. I'd drop him in his crib and run out the door as fast as I could so he wouldn't be sad and he'd sleep all night but... it never felt right.

This past week I started laying him down and looking him in the eyes, telling him I love him and I hope he gets a good sleep and he smiles so brightly my heart runs to the other end of the emotional scale. He doesn't toss and turn for 30 minutes before falling asleep, I don't stare at his camera obsessively until he finally falls asleep. We both say goodbye with a smile on our faces and I think it's made such a difference. All because I decided to just try something that felt right rather then obsessively looking up if it was okay. 

I don't expect this to be forever. In fact, as an avid participant of the internet I expect the exact opposite. But I just wanted to get it out there and leave a copy of my small win somewhere. I've lurked every baby related subreddit since the moment I found out I was pregnant and just really appreciate hearing the perspective of so many wonderful women around the world. Thank you.",beyondthebump

I’m really torn on what to do. On one hand I would love to try a VBAC. On the other hand the only person I know in real life who attempted a VBAC had a uterine rupture which makes me feel like a c-section is the safest option. Then I read the statistics and I’m torn again.

348,Weaning,"Hey everyone. I am a first time mum and my daughter turned 6 months old this week. I am utterly confused about the weaning process and what this should look like. 

I introduced baby rice / porridge a few weeks ago once a day and she is loving it. I haven't dropped any usual milk feeds and continue to offer her a 7oz bottle around every 3 hours. She sometimes sleeps through the night so has no extra milk or may wake up once for a bottle. She usually drinks around 5-6oz, occasionally less or more. 

I offered her broccoli today which she hated haha. I will continue to offer this to try and get her used to the taste/ texture. I looked up ideas for appropriate foods to offer at what age, so I understand that part fine. But when do I offer her more than 1 meal a day? Should I be reducing her milk intake if I offer more food? If so when does this happen? I've read some guides saying she should be on 3 meals a day after a few weeks and some saying by 12 months? 

Does anyone have any helpful guides they could suggest? I completely understand every baby is different and a guide may not be perfect but finding a good bedtime / wake window guide saved me around 4 weeks in when I had no idea when she should be going to bed and how long roughly she should be awake for. I roughly followed a guide (with using sleepy cues too) and her sleep has almost always been amazing and it makes me feel much more confident in what I'm doing. 

I have pretty much no experience of children before my own and I'm just very confused on how to wean her appropriately.",beyondthebump

352,Having another baby,"I know I'm not the only one... But is anyone else considering having another baby just now processing how hard having the first baby during a pandemic was?

I just wrote a huge long post and accidentally deleted it. Basically, my husband and I wanted to have two to three kids. Our first child is just over a year old and we are now talking about having a second one. The more we talk about it and the more I think about actually having another one the more I don't want to do it at all. I think I'm just now processing how hard it was to have a baby during a pandemic and I just don't want to do it again.

The first year of my son's life was so difficult and isolating that I just can't imagine doing it again. The next baby would most likely be born during a pandemic also, it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere soon, so I can only imagine another year of isolation and loneliness. My husband was also not very helpful during my son's first year, especially not during the first 6 months. I breastfed and did every single feed, night and day, alone for the entire first year of his life. I knew he couldn't help with that, but I asked him to at least come and keep me company in the nursery while I fed my son and most the time he could not be bothered. The only time I remember him coming in and keeping me company he sat on the floor and basically asked me what did I want him to do while he was there. He played on his phone the whole time. It's probably obvious from this post to my others that we don't have a great relationship, so the idea of having another baby and having to be on 24/7 baby duty alone makes me anxious.

We just saw friends that had a new baby and the wife was telling me how much her husband is so helpful and loves to be there during seeds and wakes up overnight with her every time and it just made me sad. Maybe I have a husband problem more than I have a pandemic problem LOL he has lots of strengths, but we're just in a really rough low patch right now.

Anyway, this one got long also, so tell me Reddit, has anyone else been considering having another baby and feeling the same way? Am I just processing the difficulty of having a baby a year later?",beyondthebump

She is still eating, but we have to play around with our schedule during the day because sometimes she doesn't want her full bottle, we have to make smaller amounts of formula, or she won't take it at all but is still very fussy.

He has picked up SO much of my slack the last 16months with our new baby. Cooking supper/laundry etc. But we’ve also had sooo many life stresses in the last 3 years. 

(this conversation stems from me explaining to him that he adds so much extra stress on me because he comes home and is always resentful that things aren’t usually in line) dishes everywhere, laundry not done for days. We have (out of unit laundry) and we Cosleep so I can’t leave our house. Meanwhile I’m really struggling with my mental health and focus all my energy on taking care of our 16 month old while trying to recover in therapy and trying new meds.

372,"VENT: Mom said she’d help me with the baby if I came to stay with her, but she isn’t","Basically what the title says. My mom has been begging us to bring baby for an extended stay with her and my dad across the country from where we live while WFH is still in effect. We were worried about a lot of things (the Delta variant and traveling, taking baby away from her home environment, the loss of daily routine and control over our surroundings, the fact that it’s a huge PITA to pack up the gajillion things we need for the baby and bring them on an airplane, etc.). However, they managed to talk us into it, and our daughter’s ped said it was fine to bring her even with Delta, so here we are. 

My mom told me I wouldn’t have to worry about meals, housework, baby, or anything else while we are here, and I could just relax. Even so, I still planned on doing the vast majority of baby-related tasks and obviously stuff for my husband and me like our laundry, picking up after ourselves, buying dinner for everyone a few times a week, and all that sort of thing. I like taking care of my daughter and I don’t even want someone else to take over. My issue is that my mom isn’t living up to her end of the deal at all. She’s cooked a couple of meals and stayed home with baby once while we went to dinner (but after I had put baby down for the evening…so really nothing but sitting in her living room as she’d normally do. I could pay a sitter at home, np). Otherwise, I’m doing all baby-related tasks and housework, but for four adults and a baby instead of two adults and a baby. Her housekeeper hasn’t been able to come regularly since Covid because housekeeper’s kids have been out of school, whereas my housekeeper actually does come once a week at home, meaning I have less housework at home. I do housework and baby care at home and don’t mind at all, but I feel like I was lured here under false premises. My mom plays with the baby, but it consists of five minutes of cooing at baby and then she’s back on her phone as usual. It seems like her main motive for asking us here is so a parade of her friends can meet my baby (although, again, Delta). She is also obsessed with taking baby out for walks for some reason, which is fine except the temps are in the mid-90s here and my poor baby gets uncomfortable in the heat, so I put the kibosh on that and my mom doesn’t like it.

I’m going insane. I have less time to myself than I normally do at home; we’re out of our familiar surroundings; and we’re very isolated here and don’t know anyone. They live in a big city but in an out-of-the way neighborhood that’s a long walk from even basic places like Target, while we live in a walkable and convenient neighborhood. I’m not allowed to drive my mom’s $100k SUV, nor would I really even want to. I feel like a teenager begging rides when I’m a grown-ass woman in my 30s. If I try to talk to my mom about it, she gets angry and defensive. We’re supposed to be here for an entire month and I’m not sure if I can. However, the idea of packing all our stuff up and going back home when we just got here is a lot.

Anyway, just a long-winded vent. I should’ve seen this coming a mile away. I learned my lesson and will not be doing this again.",beyondthebump

383,How do you get your 2-3 month old to nap?,"Hello,

My 2.5 month old started sleeping well at nighttime at a specific hour everyday (her doing) which was a huge relief from the bedtime hassle I had couple weeks ago. I guess having a bedtime routine since week 3 helped but who knows, really. However, the same cannot be said about naps.

Once in a blue moon I can get an hour and a half nap, but mostly it's catnapping for 10-30 mins and those take me so much effort to accomplish. Granted, those naps don't leave LO rested enough so there's a lot of fuss during the day.

389,11 week old hates naps,My boy is 11 weeks old tomorrow. He is generally very laid back apart from having issues with gas and a new hatred for naps! I'm aware that napping becomes more challenging at this age but am looking for tips and advice on how to make the getting to sleep bit easier as well as prolonging the length. He currently cries every time it comes to napping regardless of wake window. He no longer reliably nurses to sleep and always wakes up when we put him in his moses basket. This means contact naps with about 15 minutes of rocking and shushing to get him to sleep and stop screaming. Any advice? Thanks!,beyondthebump
390,I don’t know how much longer I can exclusively pump for. Feeling like a failure.,"I am currently 3 weeks 1 day postpartum. I tried breastfeeding directly from the breast for the first few days, but it was very stressful and not very successful (he has a tongue and lip tie). I then switched to exclusively pumping. I pump every three hours everyday. I don’t have a support system other than my partner who works all day. I have to do laundry and dishes etc during the day as well as look after my newborn, as well as try to sneak in a nap so I’m not completely sleep deprived. All this on top of pumping every three hours is driving me crazy. During the night, baby will wake up for a feed, so I will go prepare him a bottle, then when he’s settled and back to sleep, I have to them go wash bottles and pump parts, steralize them and get ready for the next pumping session. It’s like I never get a break. I don’t know what to do. He’s only 3 weeks old and I already want to quit. I feel terrible as everyone tells me breast milk is best and to keep trying. I’m thinking of perhaps trying to make it to 6 weeks, and then doing a combination of pumping breast milk and formula. Any advice on what I can do to lessen the stress?",beyondthebump

I’ve already done three donations to free up freezer space but now that she’s a little solid eating queen I would love to be able to use some of that milk for cooking. I make big batches pancakes and banana bread for her using fresh milk. My question is, would it be dangerous to thaw some frozen person juice, cook/bake with it and then freeze the resulting treats? I know all the rules about using thawed milk within 24 hours but I didn’t know if baking it would change things.

394,Swaddling,My 2.5 week old hates to be swaddled. But she also has a startle reflex. The only way to manage getting her into a swaddle is waiting until she falls asleep nursing and then slowly swaddling her with a muslin blanket. She hates the SwaddleMe wraps and I prefer them since they are safer. She ALWAYS gets out of the muslin blanket no matter how snug. And last night she scared me and got the blanket over her face so i decided to try the SwaddleMe again while she was asleep. She fussed in her sleep all night but kept going back to sleep but I could tell she was uncomfortable. Not sure what to do since she seems to generally hate anything weighing her / strapping her down. But doesn’t mind it if shes unaware and sleeping. She will wake herself up if unswaddled.,beyondthebump

I had him young, I was 20, im 21 now. 
I guess I just had no idea what I was getting myself into? The PPD and PPA started in the hospital after delivery. I had postpartum hemorrhage and had emergency surgery on my uterus right after natural birth. I couldn’t hold my son until the next day. He was healthy thank god and I survived but it was such a traumatic experience and I couldn’t believe the hospital would send me home like that and expect me to now take care of an infant at the same time as trying to recover. My son slept for an hour at a time for a few months. I cried constantly. I think back then I regretted it a bit but it has gotten much easier. 
But still. I had him so young that it’s so hard. I wish I had my shit together. I don’t miss the partying and going out, I barely ever do that anyway and I barely have friends. I just wish I was older and had my career established and didn’t have to work 55 hours a week just for us to survive. I been trying to go back to school on top of working full time and I literally can’t because I can’t ask my family to watch him 24/7. Can’t afford to not work either. 
The guilt when I’m away from him is so strong it consumes me. Even when I am with him I feel guilty for every second we aren’t interacting or he’s alone playing. I barely even eat anymore all I do is make sure he’s good. I’m worried for my health and I’m so tired of feeling such bad guilt 24/7 it takes away the joy of motherhood..",beyondthebump

404,Baby came 1.5 months early. How to deal with the next month+?,"So I was definitely not expecting yesterday. My partner had been up the whole previous night complaining of feeling really sick. The next morning before I left for work I told her if she's still bad, call the hospital and see what they want her to do and to let me know right away.
Of course she didn't let me know, she just texted me 2 or so hours later saying she's on her way to the hospital. Cue the panic. So after some back and forth texting she called me and said they're contractions and to get to the hospital right now.

Turns out she needed to go for an emergency c section as the baby was in breach and ready to go. After about an hour, our little girl came out and we couldn't be happier.
So now, because she's so early and is having some issues with jaundice, she'll be in the hospital (NICU) for a minimum of 3-4 weeks, more than likely longer. My partner will probably be out within the week, but we're not sure how to deal with not being able to see our girl all the time or take her with us?
Also with covid, unfortunately we can only see her 1 at a time, this is going to be very tough and we both feel so helpless.

Me and my fiance obviously don't plan on dieing any time soon but neither of us want our parents to ever raise our children. Be a grandparent and see them sure, but definitely not be their soul caregivers. So we feel it's pretty important to get someone picked and have it written up so there's no questions if God forbid something happened to us. Our friends and my oldest sister are tied as choices so we're going to ask them both. If they both say yes we would like that because then if one couldn't take them there's a second option. We only have one child now but want 3 in total, our friends want to start a family too so having three kids pushed on them when they'll have kids of their own might be too much for them. My sister on the other hand will only have my nephew but she doesn't live close so our kids would have to leave everyone here behind if they moved in with her. And our friends are only a 15min drive away. So there's pros and cons of both but we still think having them both be options would be the best. How should we best ask and explain the situation to them? I just get really nervous when asking things of others and weird sentences end up waterfalling out of my mouth.",beyondthebump

418,Why can’t my husband just be present?,"Really just need to rant and get this out, and also could do with getting some advice. My husband has such a small cup to give from in relationships. It seems like he’s always exhausted. Whenever I ask him to watch our 7 month old baby or whenever its his “on duty”, you know what his “on duty” looks like? Having the TV on and watching it while baby plays by herself on the floor or in the exersaucer. He is completely tuned out while he watches TV. I could speak to him and he doesn’t hear me. I watch from afar and she will start to fuss and get fussier until she’s all-out crying and then he pays attention, and his “attention” is just giving her a toy then going right back to TV or phone. I try to take my “break” but how the FUCK do you take a break and try to calm down while in a separate room while I KNOW this shit is going on? Am I overreacting??? I fucking showed him the still face experiment video, we talk about attachment, he KNOWS how important showing his actual FACE to our daughter in interactions is. I cannot tell you how often we talk about this in counseling, in every day life, whatever, but he never changes. He RARELY actually plays with her, face to face. He’s always doing something else. Meanwhile I’m crazy overstimulated at the end of the day and the last thing I want is to hear more noise in the form of TV. So I get angry that he’s not only not watching her, but also making my stress worse with the TV. I ask him to turn it off and he gets mad at me. 

Oh and this also happens when HE VOLUNTEERS to watch the baby. He’s like “hey you look stressed out, let me take over tonight.” (This happened tonight.) So I look on DoorDash to place an order and get up to do some laundry. He put LO in pack and play visible with baby monitor to see if she was tired, but we weren’t sure. She fusses for 15 minutes in there and is rolling around clearly not tired. I’m trying to get this other stuff done since HE VOLUNTEERED to watch her, and I just see him out of the corner of my eye on his smartphone and clearly not paying attention to the baby monitor. 15 more minutes go by and I ask if he’s going to get her because she clearly isn’t tired and he’s like “oh you want me to get her?” THE ACTUAL FUCK? Then he goes and gets her, comes down and just puts her in the exersaucer and goes back on his phone. She starts fussing so I play with her. Then he gets annoyed and is like I thought you were going to take a break? And it takes everything in me not to scream back, I CAN’T FUCKING RELAX IF I KNOW SHE’S BEING ABANDONED UNDER YOUR “CARE.” Why would you offer if you’re tapped out tonight? That’s the most frustrating thing. I (sort of) understand if you have nothing left, but don’t offer to do it and then zero-ass it.

Am I overreacting?? What would you do? We talk and talk nothing changes. We have couples counseling. He has individual counseling and is on antidepressants but honestly neither seem to ever help him, grow up. I am exhausted being the sole parent to TWO children, apparently. Why can’t you just not have the TV on for 2 seconds? Why can’t you give more than 4 minutes of face time to our daughter? Then he gets mad that I never take up his offers to take breaks, NO SHIT I DON’T. YOU’RE NEVER ACTUALLY PRESENT.

435,Childcare during delivery with Delta in mind?,"A little background, we had our first born August 2020 and have been pretty isolated since the pandemic initially started.  We had a brief period where we were a bit relaxed after getting vaccinated and returned back to social distancing once delta hit.  Our second born is due in a few months (October) and I am so conflicted on how to address child care for our first born when I deliver.  I didn’t take any chances when COVID first hit and now more than ever I feel the need to isolate since Delta is more dangerous for kids and everyone around us is basically “back to normal” since they are protected/vaccinated.  I just can’t see myself leaving our son with anyone at this point. 

This past year and a half has honestly been extremely lonely because I could barely get anyone to social distance/quarantine when our son was first born and that was BEFORE vaccines.  Don’t get me wrong; I am grateful for the protection and to be vaccinated myself, but it’s like to everyone around us is blind to breakthrough cases and how vulnerable children are right now.  That being said, although we have many volunteers, I know no one in our circle would be willing to quarantine before birth, especially because I would ideally like to have them quarantine the whole month in case I deliver early again.

Covid aside, I’ve never left our son with anyone except my husband due to social distancing, so I don’t have trust built up with anyone else at this point.  The amount of pushback I’ve gotten with safety protocols and boundaries I have had in the past make me unsure that family would even respect the routine we’ve created or even keep their mask on when over if asked.  It’s unfortunate but true.  Between how I’ve seen positive cases handled in our circle, lack of transparency, and by falsely labeling everything as “quarantining” and “staying in our bubble”; this past year and a half has been one big validation that I’ve been right to be cautious.  

The hospital staff member I spoke with predicts no visitors (besides one support person) will be allowed regardless of testing or vaccination status around my due date.  That ruins the slim hope I had of bringing our 1 year old to the hospital.  At this point, I want to eliminate any chance of covid entering our bubble, especially with another newborn and avoid stress/anxiety by delivering alone and having my husband stay home with our son.  My husband is absolutely heartbroken, but I feel like I have no options.  I know it will be scary, but the thought of leaving him with anyone else or possibly exposing him to covid terrifies me more.  

Is anyone else in a similar predicament?  Or have any advice?  Or words of comfort?  Anything?  I am so conflicted and any insight would be much appreciated 😩",beyondthebump

437,Just took my 4 week old into the shower… game changer!,"Our son has been having reflux issues, and so we are trying to give his belly some time to digest in between feedings… but often he will start crying very soon after a feeding, only being consoled by the breast, which just makes the issue worse. So, after trying a pacifier and other methods to calm him, I decided to bring him into the shower with me while Mom stood out side ready to take him with a towel. The combination of the soothing shower sound plus the warm water calmed him down instantly! Yes, he poo’d on me, but it was worth it to see him so calm and intrigued by this new experience! Plus killed two birds with one stone by letting me have a nice warm shower

445,This is how I'm tracking my daughter sleep time,"Hi everyone,

For the past few weeks, I have been looking for alternatives that allow me to understand my baby's sleep schedule so that I can make adjustments to it. I am not interested in being told the ideal sleep schedules, I understand each baby is different, so I’ve learned that it is more about finding her own schedule.

In order to make adjustments to the sleep schedule and duration, I’ve found it essential to be able to record each sleep event. So I started documenting it in a spreadsheet but it’s been difficult because I don't always have my computer or smartphone handy. The last thing I want is to make noise once my daughter falls asleep.

The one device that’s always with me is my AppleWatch.

I found some apps app out there but none really hit the mark:

1. To record sleep events, silently and fast.

2. To easily compare how much she has slept in the last few days and be able to match it with her behavior and mood.

So I decided to try it on my own and created an app prototype that I have been testing for a few weeks and so far, it has worked well for me. 

I’d love for you to take a look at the app and share your feedback!

You can try it here: [https://previewer.adalo.com/a8694631-eeb7-49e2-ab22-675efe7fc10a](https://previewer.adalo.com/a8694631-eeb7-49e2-ab22-675efe7fc10a)

462,"C-section moms: was anybody given a surgery date you DIDN'T want, and how did you handle it?","I've posted this is an few other subs, but I thought I'd ask here. 

I'm 17 weeks and decided to try to get my c-section scheduled early to get ahead of the game. I talked to one of the doctors at my practice, and she was cool with trying to get something on the schedule at this time. My due date is January 18, which means technically my options for c-section is anywhere between January 11-January 18, not counting the weekend of course, since scheduled c-sections without urgent medical needs happen at 39 weeks. 

Ideally, I wanted January 12 but I was fine with any day **EXCEPT** the 13th. January 13th is my FIL's birthday and due to lack of reliable childcare starting that day, if we have the surgery on the 13th, my husband won't be able to attend the birth, as he'll have to stay home with our toddler. 

Well, OF COURSE, my doctor's office scheduled it for the 13th. I sent a few messages back and forth between to the nurses and they told me that's the only day available. I told them I was fine with any doctor performing the c-section, if that would open up more time slots. Nope. Eventually they stopped responding to me. 

I tried calling L&amp;D at the hospital as well as my doctor's office and they refused to cancel the surgery until my next doctor appointment, saying I needed to discuss it with the doctor. The receptionist at the doctors office was more kind/reassuring, saying that it's so far in advance that we should definitely be able to work something out and not to fret. She said if I bring up my concerns with the doctor during my next visit, we should be able to work something out, but that is totally opposite of what the nurses said. 

I talked to DH about it and even though he too is a little disappointed in the date, he is 100% opposed to switching practices at this point just because of the birth date. I'm even a little wary of this myself because I really do like all the doctors at my practice. Also, what if I go through the big to-do of switching practices, only for the same thing to happen? There's no guarantee that another practice could offer me the flexibility I'm seeking, right?

I was warned about baby blues, but nothing about the anxiety. In general I just wish aftercare was better for moms. There is just such a push to be healed like instantly and be on top of everything, but if you choose to be a stay at home mom you're automatically assumed you have no education and you're lazy. I'm breastfeeding and had no idea you should be consuming additional calories, continue taking vitamin D, and how hungry/thirsty it makes you. I was feeling really dizzy for a few days and started watching what I eat. Well that was it... some days I'd run on coffee, water and a multivitamin until 5pm.

My daughter is almost 15 months old. She transitioned from formula to whole around her 1st birthday with zero problems. She’s only ever drank whole milk between then and now except for two occasions.

A month ago, we were visiting her grandparents and we didn’t have whole milk with us and thought she’d be fine having 2% milk. She had about 2 bottles of it. The next day she started to come down with a fever and was very uncomfortable and throwing up. After a few days she recovered. 

I didn’t think the 2% milk was any link to her illness until now. The other day was kind of the same situation, this time she only had maybe 4oz of 2% milk and the next day she’s got a fever and is super uncomfortable. Not throwing up and isn’t as extreme as the last time she was sick but it dawned on me that it just so happened that she had 2% milk right before getting sick each time.

2. When I give my baby formula, I give him 3 oz and he can finish 3 oz just fine with some spit up sometimes. Does this mean that every time I bf, he demands 3 oz of milk each time I bf? I’m afraid that my baby may not be getting enough of my breast milk because I don’t think my body produces 3 oz each feed. When I pump, I produce a total of 1-2 oz. Could this explain why he’s hungry every 2 hours? Is it supposed to be improving? I still feed 10-12 times in 24 hours

I’m still trying to figure it out but the every 2 hours feed is really making me exhausted and I cannot imagine how I could go back to work if his demand stays the same (I will be working from home and taking care of him at home)",beyondthebump
475,3 weeks postpartum,"Hey all,
I am officially 3 weeks pp today. And I haven't been bleeding at all. For like the past week, I'd say? Last week I had some very small spots of blood here and there and maybe a very tiny clot. But nothing anymore. Should I still be wearing pads/ using the witch hazel? I am still sore. It's definitely getting much better by the days! But I'm just curious. Also, is it normal to be done with bleeding so soon pp? This is my 2nd child (I had a VBAC this time around) and I felt like with my 1st (after having a c section) I bled very very heavily and for a lot longer. Anyway, thanks for reading this and if you took the time to respond.",beyondthebump
476,Really struggling today - baby born at 35+2,"Hello, not sure where to post this, but really having a hard morning and need to vent. Hope it’s ok to do that here. 

After having a really uneventful pregnancy, my water broke 5 days ago at 35+2. I was asleep and woke up to it breaking so I have no idea why it happened. I was induced and was so scared that the baby wouldn’t make it, that she would be silent coming into the world. But after a pretty straightforward labor and delivery, our daughter was born. She cried immediately, and weighed 5lb 6oz, cute as a little button. I was so relieved to hear her cry, that my brain instantly told itself that everything was fine, but she was sent to the NICU shortly after birth. 

I was in a state of bliss the first couple of days at the hospital. I think I was so relieved she was alive that to me, even though she was in the NICU, she was totally fine. In reality, she was having trouble breathing on her own when she was born and was put on an oxygen pump overnight. She also can’t eat well on her own, so is being fed by a tube until she learns to feed from a bottle. All the doctors and nurses are very reassuring that she is healthy, just early. Once she learns to feed from a bottle, she can come home. They were all confident that it would be a short stay. And I believed it all until I was discharged and went home without her. 

I think it just hit me this morning that she really is in the NICU and that she really has these obstacles to overcome. I just realized looking at photos of her, how many wires and tubes are hooked up to her little body. I was sure she would be home by this weekend but that’s not looking likely. 

I feel so guilty, like I failed to keep her safe in my belly for long enough. Why did my water break? Maybe if I had taken it easy, maybe if I wasn’t so stressed all week, it wouldn’t have happened. Now that we are back from the hospital, people keep telling me how great I look and and how it doesn’t even seem like I had a baby. It just makes me feel worse. I didn’t make it to full term, that’s why it doesn’t look like I just had a baby. And the trade off is my baby in the NICU struggling to eat and losing weight. 

I want to believe this is all temporary but I can’t stop crying this morning. I would trade how easy my pregnancy was for a healthy baby at home with me. I’m not sure what I’m looking for in this post but just need to get it off my chest. Thank you ♥️",beyondthebump

478,Am I that good at handling trauma? Or Ppd symptoms?,"Hey everyone, long post alert. 
I have a dumb question please don't judge. How do you know if you have ppd?
I had my perfect little boy on May  4th. And things have been going down hill for me since then horribly.(not counting the terrible pregnancy) 

My entire family ended up covid positive as I was going into labour. My dad was in the icu and almost did not make it. 
I had a traumatic birth (ended up with a c section after laboring forever ) where I saw my son not breathing and the doctor freaking. Lots of trauma and my incision was extremely painful because of a hidden fibroid in the way. Till that all the doctors were making fun of me saying I had no Pain tolerance. 
Within a few days my son got really severe jaundice and had to be hospitalized and I had to pump and feed every hour and my nipple literally split through. And I still could even walk to the bathroom without help thanks to the excruciating pain from the c section. The male pediatricians there actually told me it was my fault because I was not getting enough milk. I pumped and showed them that I was getting more than enough and they straight up said I was lying.

My husband decided to become an ass of of nowhere and became very abusive towards me and I also found him talking to some cam girl in between all of this.(he's since apologized saying he did know what came over him). He literally pushed me around in the hospital and ignored me when I cried for help and the nurses had to take care of me.
Baby blues hit me like a truck and I cried for 3 weeks straight 
Then I ended up with pregnancy induced gallbladder disease and started getting frequent attacks so painful I had to have morphine. 
Those attacks really messed me up and it was decided I needed to get another surgery.
So in just a few weeks after my c section I had my gallbladder out and right there in the hospital my supply started to drop and I had to pump day and night through the horrible pain yet again without any food or water. 
I got my period 5 weeks pp and damn it has been soooo bad mostly because of the fibroid. 
After I came home my son refused to nurse from me with nipple confusion and it took me everything I had to get him back. 
Just when I thought I was recovering my incisions got infected and the stitches cut through my flesh and started to sink and I have been in much pain.

Now this is my question. I've been through all this but I feel nothing. Like I'm blank and numb. I'm not happy nor am I sad. I love my son but I feel like I have no energy for him at all so I just keep finding ways to give him to someone else to baby sit. I'm only with him to feed. I keep waiting for a mental breakdown to happen but somehow I feel fine. My brain just keeps saying ""whatever"" to everything. My mom accidentally dropped a heavy pot on my foot and I did not even flinch. I just thought meh what's one more round of pain. Am I really that good at handling all this trauma?",beyondthebump
479,I need advice,"I am a single parent of a 7month old baby and I have had it. I don’t get any kind of help from the other parent or even family. The only time I consider peace and alone time is when I go to sleep for night, I am with my baby 24/7 working from home and the last straw for me now is the middle of night wakings.

480,Do we really have to sleep in the same bedroom as the babe?,"I know this is a hot topic and plz be patient and try to be understanding. We have a brand new baby girl and we are so so excited to have her and love her to pieces. She was born August 7th at 4 am and we are trying to find places for her to settle. We have figured out pacifiers and swaddles have worked great. We are however having issues with her in the bassinet beside us. She just will not settle there. However she will settle in her crib. She is breastfed and doing great with that. Me and my hubby were just wondering how important is itnshe stay in the same room as us? We are currently taking shifts every 2 or 3 hours because I have to get up to feed her at those points anyways, and sitting in the nursery beside her in the crib where she remains calm and settled. So I feel if we have a monitor in our room with the sound on high we would be ok since I have no issue getting up and going down the hall every few hours to feed her then going back to sleep. At least my sleep would be mostly consecutive and everyone gets to sleep and is happier. But the recommended time babies stay in the room is around 3-4 months minimum. I'm also personally not comfortable with the idea of bed sharing and would like to 100% avoid this. So I feel this is a solution for our family. Am I crazy thinking like this?",beyondthebump
481,Waking up randomly in a panic that I fell asleep with baby with me in the bed and I check and she's not there,I do this about 3 or 4 times a night.

482,Unsure of ourselves and constantly worrying,"My husband and I just had our first baby 3 days ago! While we are so in love with her, I will honestly say that we are not adjusting well to her actually being here. We’re not sleeping, we are constantly worrying about her every move and sound, and we literally just got home on the 10th. My parents live close and his parents are coming this weekend but we are both so overwhelmed.

Personally, I am having a hard time adjusting to postpartum. I had 3 tears and the pain is not something I was ready for. I can’t even sit down or stand up without being in intense pain and I’m always scared about the bleeding that I know is normal but worry it might be too much. I can literally feel the blood coming out onto the pads and underwear combination and it isn’t even that much but I worry that it is. My bleeding and pain went down 2 days after delivery but has picked back up on the third day. Not to mention my feet are incredibly swollen that I can barely walk and it seems like they just keep getting bigger. I’m scared that something else might be wrong even though it’s probably not.",beyondthebump
483,"Help! Silent Reflux nightmare, switching to formula","My four week old has been suffering from what I'm sure is silent reflux basically since birth. We suffered for weeks before I stumbled upon a blog post about silent reflux and could relate to every single symptom: the coughing cry, arching her back while breastfeeding, the comfort nursing for hours, the wheezing and labored breathing, the endless screaming.. the list goes on. They say babies start to smile socially at around six weeks, but at this point I'm not sure my baby will ever smile since she always seems to be in pain. She can only sleep in someone's arms or in the Boppy lounger (under supervision), and the few times she's awake she's screaming. We've tried frequent burping and keeping her upright for 30 minutes after eating but the symptoms just keep getting worse every day. It doesn't help that the in-laws are over to help out and insist on waterboarding the baby every time they give her a bottle instead of paced bottle feeding. 

I can't help but wonder if I've caused this by my constant waffling between breastfeeding and formula. We've supplemented from the beginning but she has always seemed so much more content (and able to sleep alone in her crib!) on formula. There have been many instances where I've tried to blow things up and switch to EFF only to be pressured back into breastfeeding after a day or two. I think that this plus multiple changes to her formula (Similac Pro-Advance to Similac Sensitive to now a half-and-half mixture of Parent's Choice Gentle and Similac Sensitive) has wreaked havoc on her digestive system. She's passing these enormous, liquidy poos that obviously cause her a lot of pain and has been choking on her milk, saliva, air, you name it. She explosively vomited milk curds onto my chest the other night. Lately she's even been arching her back and refusing the bottle which has never happened before. I'm so heartbroken that I might have ruined my baby's relationship with eating and caused her so much pain just because I pushed to breastfeed against my better instincts. 

I've tried adjusting my diet but have read that it can take weeks to see any changes to my breast milk. I simply refuse to put my baby in pain for any longer if I can help it. Besides, they also recommend cutting soy from your diet in addition to dairy, cruciferous veggies, etc. I am Asian, not eating soy is like not eating salt: it's almost impossible and would make my life miserable. Doesn't my mental health matter too? So at this point I've committed to EFF (for good this time!) and am searching for affordable options to support baby's needs. Should I continue with Parent's choice Gentle to see if she takes to it better in the absence of breastfeeding? We've started adding probiotics to one bottle a day and will see if that helps too. If we need to switch to a hypoallergenic formula, are there decent store brand alternatives to Nutramigen and Alimentum so that we don't break the bank if we can help it? 

For others who have gone through this, how long did it take before you saw an improvement? I'm hoping to limit how long she has to take medication if possible. If we can address this without any medication at all that would be lovely too. 

We're seeing the pediatrician in a couple days but are desperate for any advice here. My parents and in-laws keep telling us that all new parents struggle at first, but this can't be normal. I'd mentally prepared to wake up every 2-3 hours with a newborn, but at this point I'm praying for more than five minutes of sleep at a time. My husband once broke down after hours of screaming, saying ""Why does she hate me?"" I just want to enjoy parenthood for once and a baby who isn't miserable all the time.",beyondthebump

501,10 weeks PP and appendicitis,"Little bit of background. I’m a SAHM of a 2 yo and a 10 wo. 

2 1/2 weeks ago I started having abdominal pain. It lasted a week and a half before getting bad enough to make me go into the Immediate care on a Friday. They thought it was GERD so prescribed Pepcid twice a day and I went home. I returned Monday after pushing through pain and nausea all day before calling my husband to come home early from work to take over the kids. 

I arrived at Immediate care around 3:30/4 and they said I’d need to go to the ER. At that point I couldn’t drive as I was throwing up (for the record - throwing up 10 wks after a c-section is NO JOKE). A friend came to get me and we arrived at the ER around 6. It was a long process but was finally diagnosed as appendicitis at 11pm via CT. 

I was admitted and high as a kite by midnight because the pain was so bad. They schedule my surgery for 10:30am the next day. My surgery rolled around and they discovered that not only did I have appendicitis but that my appendix had burst and had been burst for a few days. Apparently there was pus everywhere; my liver, my intestines, my pelvic. The surgeon who sees these all the time kept telling me it was BAD. 

Well I had a drain placed during surgery and when it was removed it was PAINFUL. I suspect my still healing c-section body made it more traumatic than it normally is. The following drain I had to have another drain placed and then the following day it was removed and I finally got to go home. 

Eight days. I was away from my babies for eight days and by day six I was broken. I know for some people it wouldn’t be a big deal but for me my heart is broken. 

Even home I still find myself crying over the time I was away. My brain hasn’t healed from my absence and I’m not sure when it will.

What can happen if they are around my child? They’re also ALWAYS sick which ticks me off because when I was pregnant they would never tell me they’re sick and would give me their illness. I also got COVID-19 from them. 
I don’t want them around my child and I told my husband his response was “your family is allowed near him why can’t mine be?” There’s a difference because my family is vaccinated and super careful with being around people and traveling. 
My in laws always ask to visit and once before I got a chance to answer I hopped out of the shower and they were over. (they live near me)

Me and my baby where doing tummy time he was lying on my tummy and he lifted his head and we both clashed heads it was only a little bang but it was big to him and he started to scream and cry I feel so terrible like I'm a horrible mother..am I? It was a genuine mistake but I can’t shake these feelings I feel I put him in dangerous way.

I'm not sure how to go about navigating the tantrums my toddler has when learning. For example - he's learning to stack those donut shapes onto the peg. When he gets it he's so excited, he claps, we clasp it's great. If he can't get the shape on the peg on the first try he throws it across the room in a fit. Any reassurance we give him or attempt to have him keep trying just results in things being thrown. How can we encourage him to keep trying, preferably without everything getting broken in the process lol He's 16 months for context.",beyondthebump

So I just put the little guy down on his play gym mat for tummy time. He was moving and kicking his legs at the beginning, but opted to just lay there and look at his toys for the remainder. He was so mellow on the mat that he fell asleep after 20 minutes. 

Since he wasn’t doing much, does this still count toward his daily goal?

Also, I think he just got really comfortable. I don’t think it’s a matter of ability or anything wrong. He picks his head up a ton and looks at me when he does tummy time on me. He also likes to (try to) sit up himself when being burped. I think this baby gym is just too comfy haha.",beyondthebump

531,Baby with milk allergy,"I really need some advice, my baby girl is 2 months old and I was breastfeeding and pumping up until about 4 days ago. I suspected she has a milk protein allergy as she has most of the symptoms of it. It’s to difficult for me to cut dairy out so I switched her to alimentum. I introduced it the first few days along with breast milk (I was using ready to feed) and she seemed okay. Then I cut the breast milk out and switched to the powder formula and she hates it. She went from eating 3-5 Oz of breast milk every 3 hours to only eating 1-2 Oz of formula every 3-5 hours. I can barley get her to eat and last night she had the worst night she has ever had just screaming for hours and hours and nothing I did would help. She tries to drink the formula but goes on and off the bottle crying. I’m just confused on what to do. She cries like something is hurting her. She stiffens her whole body up and acts like she is in pain. My pediatrician is honestly no help. All I was told was to keep giving her the formula for a few weeks before I decide anything else because she said it takes that long to see a difference but if it’s causing her more pain I do not want to continue it. Also, she had no blood in her poop until I switched her to the formula which I was never really given an answer to why that was. I can always switch to the ready to feed but I’m just lost as to if this formula is even working for her. It seems to be making it worse on her some days. She will go a day where she won’t sleep for 10-12 hours or more except for maybe a 5 minute nap and she seems so uncomfortable She also seemed this way with my breast milk. Does anyone have any unsuccessful stories with alimentum but success with another formula? Or have a similar situation? I just want my girl to feel better. I got her referred to a GI specialist but I feel like a failure at this point because I can’t seem to help her pain 😞 She does have acid reflux as well. I go back to work in two weeks and I can’t be okay leaving her at daycare knowing she is like this. 😔",beyondthebump

533,Period after baby,"I have formula fed from the beginning so I got my period quite quickly (6 weeks post partum). I then got another period about a month later. I then started birth control. 3 weeks into taking the birth control I got one day of spotting, one day heavy bleeding (this is what my periods used to be before I was pregnant) so I figured that was my period. But then the spotting kept coming the day after the heavy bleeding. This lasted two weeks. I decided to stop the birth control after a week of spotting to let my body sort its hormones out. I felt I didn't wait long enough after birth.  


Now it has been a few days past the 1 month mark from the heavy bleeding day (day I suspected was my potential last period?)

534,Can your body stop responding to a pump if you haven’t used one in a while?,"Context: I’m a high school teacher. We started off last year fully virtual so I worked at home and exclusively breastfed. I collected extra milk with the Elvie curve (similar to the Haakaa just a different shape) and would occasionally pump for practice. When we switched to a hybrid model, I pumped at work twice a day and was able to get pretty much exactly what LO was eating while I was away. 

For the past two months, I haven’t pumped at all because I didn’t need to. Now I’m worried that may have been a mistake. LO is 11 months next week and drinks milk 4 times a day (once in the morning, once while I’m at work, once right after work, and once before bed). The problem is that she’s drinking an 8 oz bottle while I’m away and I’m only pumping 2 oz. I have a small freezer stash for now but they’ll be gone soon at this rate. 

What should I do? If I run out will she be ok with just solid food while I’m at work?

535,6+ Month Bottle Upgrade? Is this a thing?,"So, my son is nearly 7 months. He has never been a big fan of being in a reclined position to have his bottle. Lately hes been wanting to control where the bottle is while he sits up, he doesnt like it above him blocking his view, he wants it down lower. The issue is the bottles we have do not provide suction (tommee tippee anti colic) so hes not getting any formula when he does this. He gets frustrated, I get frustrated, everyone gets frustrated. He just wants to basically suck his formula out like with a straw but hes far too little for something like that (is he?). My moms advice is to get the bottles that have disposable liners because they can suck it out any way they want, but I'm not thrilled about disposable liners. 1) waste 2) added cost. 

Does anyone have any advice on if theres a bottle out there for a 7 month old who just wants to have his bottle down out of his face? Is there a bottle out there that could help? I'm not even sure if he *needs* the anti colic ones anymore as we've just been using them since hes about 2 months and havent bothered switching them out.

537,Rice Cereal - Not a good idea when starting to feed solids?,"I came across this news article: [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/w\_ParentingResource/baby-diet-white-rice-cereal-pediatrician-dr-alan-greene-focuses/story?id=12801589](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_ParentingResource/baby-diet-white-rice-cereal-pediatrician-dr-alan-greene-focuses/story?id=12801589) 

When researching how to start my baby on solids. 

A few things stood out:

\- What is the research/personal experiences on the foods  a baby is exposed to and the likeliness of it building a long-term pattern? (much like we speak to our baby because it has shown that it helps them perform better over time - it's a compounding investment).

\- I took issue with the pediatrics association recommending any cereal that is fortified. It assumes that cereal is a good breakfast for anyone. That may not be the case: [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-marketers-invented-the-modern-version-of-breakfast/487130/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-marketers-invented-the-modern-version-of-breakfast/487130/) 

So pediatrics association making this recommendation is faulty to begin with.

\- Just because there are other factors that may contribute to overweight problems in the future - doesn't mean that starting a good diet early on doesn't matter.

\- On a one time feeding: brown rice, vs. white rice doesn't matter. But how about over time? Compounding habits and tastes? 

\- Gerber mentioned there is no data on linking rice cereal to obesity problems in the future. Do we need a study to tell us broccoli is better than rice cereal? Can't we use the research on glycemic foods as a proxy? i.e. easily digestible sugary foods vs. slowly-digested ones?

All to say is this:

I'm looking for what is out there when it comes to baby foods, and it sounds like: rice cereal, gerber purees, or even earth organic purees are not good. Just a habit supported by the organizations that benefit from them.

I would love to hear thoughts on this.

538,New mom on the block sharing a lot of info with my hubby,"I'll try to keep this short.

Disclosure: I'm in my last month so obviously emotional/may be overreacting.

Me and my husband own a shop and there is another couple in our town that owns a similar shop. We got pregnant around the same time, but they gave birth a few months earlier. The woman is thin, tall, etc. When she was in her last month she had a very small bump. My husband commented on this and I explained to him there are many different bump sizes and it doesn't necessarily mean anything. However .. she told him it's because she's very fit. Kind of implying I'm not.

The truth is I'm not. I'm not fat, but I'm not a gymrat and I never will be. I like to read and be a homebody. I do go for walks a LOT but it's because I like walking and I don't consider it working out. Ok, now that that's out of the way...

She tells him about her workouts, yoga, pilates, whatever, and how much it helped her give birth, and how she didn't tear at all, and her baby arrived exactly on her due date. My husband retells me this stuff, and now ""wants"" our baby to come on the due date too. I tried to explain to him it's just a random date and there's a bell curve, and I had the doctor help a bit with explaining this. But this woman and her perfect pregnancy and the things she tells him, which he then recounts to me, is driving me crazy.

She also is against cribs, strollers, etc. Thankfully my husband didn't go for that. But he is now kind of insisting I ""go out for a long walk"" immediately after birth and do yoga so I don't tear blah blah blah. full disclosure: I have been doing a bit of yoga an stretches, but probably not as much as this woman since it's like her whole identity (trying not to be judgemental but like ... you do yoga. we get it.)

I did blow up over this once but this little family is friends with my husband and I don't want to ruin the friendship he has with both the woman and her husband.

I know I'm probably being sensitive. I told him I don't want to be compared or expected to do things because we really just don't know how everything will go down, including what day the baby will come.

I think it's so crazy that she's portrayed her pregnancy as so perfect, including the due date, I just don't know why you'd share that info in that way and make my husband feel like there's something wrong with me if I don't do all these things, or if I tear, or if I don't feel like f*cking walking the next day.

Ok I'm done.

539,pregnancy symptoms at 5 months pp,"Hello! I am five months post-partum and still experiencing significant pregnancy symptoms. Smell and taste aversion (I truly miss the way coffee \*used\* to smell) are annoying, and joint pain is debilitating at times. My hands and wrists are especially sore, and I've started to develop lumps on a couple of my fingers at the first joint. Seems like the onset of arthritis, or the flare up of carpal tunnel.

It's really strange to me that food still smells off and that my sense of smell is still extremely heightened. I used to love to eat, and now I do it simply out of necessity. It's strange to admit that I miss eating for pleasure. Everything tastes off.

540,How much should my newborn be eating?,"Hi everyone! I’m (29F) a STM, I just had my second little boy 5 days ago at 37 weeks due to a placental abruption! At birth he was 7lbs 1oz and at his check up at the pediatrician yesterday he was 6lbs 10oz. He is much smaller than my 1 year old was as a newborn so I am trying to adjust to the difference.

At his appointment yesterday, I told them he is only eating about 1 oz every 2-3 hours. Sometimes less. Sometimes he will take 1.5 oz but it’s only happened a couple times.

She was mostly formula fed until she was 12 weeks old because of a shallow and painful latch and then I transitioned her to exclusively breastfed, then her already bad reflux got so much worse due to my milk and the 12 weeks of exposure to formula that was wrecking her gut but we didn’t know it. So I started on an elimination diet and I’m finally just now introducing her triggers to her. It’s been a long and exhausting road and she wants to comfort nurse all day and all night because she’s so clingy, and now she will bite me very hard sometimes. 

So I just want to be done, and I’m hoping to lose weight when I don’t need to eat constantly to keep my blood sugar from dropping and I want to go back on my adhd meds. 

But then I see so many people in posts talking about nursing up to 2 years old and I feel guilty for wanting to stop at 12 months. Am I going to regret not being able to calm her new toddler tantrums with boob? Or will I feel like she’s getting less nutrients because I wean her onto milk? 

So let me know why you chose to keep going after 12 months, or if you decided to wean asap as well. I’m curious.",beyondthebump

I am not sure what I should do at this point except quit my job and live off savings.

About 2-3 days a week there is a great worker in my son's daycare room. The other 2-3 days there are some pretty crappy people in there, one of them being the main daycare teacher and one being an assistant.

They are not giving him naps all morning. Sometimes he goes 5 hours without a nap and he is a 4 month old. He takes regular naps (albeit short ones) at home. I talked to the teacher in his room about making sure he has a nap that starts between 8-9. It doesn't need to be a full hour, just it should start then. Her response was her grandson does not need to take naps that much. The office manager heard her and said we could give him a nap at that time and they did, that day.

The great worker has been working hard to get him to nap in the morning (she says it's easy and he goes down fast, so it isn't like he isn't tired) but the other worker and teacher don't seem to give a shit at all.

We started off by using wet wipes but then switched to cotton pads dipped in warm water as the wipes caused some irritation. However, both produce a lot of waste.

560,When (if ever) did your baby hold their own bottle?,"My baby is ten months old. Normally she has a very independent personality- not a cuddler, wanted to feed herself with a spoon from the get go, just wants out of the stroller to explore wherever she is, etc. She's been exclusively formula fed due to us fostering then adopting her, and we have always used Como tomo bottles. She shows no interest in holding the bottle herself, and she won't drink anything unless she is kept highly entertained during the feed with funny faces or singing or music playing, and her holding and exploring a toy or crinkle book or something in her hands. I see videos on youtube of babies lounging somewhere on their own, holding and drinking a bottle. Is that normal by a certain age or did anyone have a baby like mine all the way til they were weaned? I do think it's good that our formula feeding has been a bonding time since I couldn't breastfeed her, but at the same time I can't wait til we are done with bottles. She also refuses formula if it's in anything besides a bottle, but I'm trying to work on that with her. Just curious- thanks in advance!",beyondthebump

562,New Mom and Online Shopping,"Who else is online shopping like crazy? I find myself idle, sitting with my baby in my arms a lot, so I’ve been researching every baby grunt, and online shopping to pass the time during feedings (even in the middle of the night) and contact naps (it’s hard for me to sleep during the day a la “sleep when the baby sleeps”).  Between buying fun baby stuff, Amazon recommendations to make new
Mom life easier, and things to help my baby with gas/sleeping/etc. it’s getting silly.  

With going back to work upon me in a few weeks, I’m now focused on trying to find clothes that’ll fit my now fluffier body without actually knowing what is going to fit/flatter me in this new shape - unfortunately in-person shopping is pretty nonexistent in my area for my size in general (borderline plus size and super tall!) so I’m stuck crossing my fingers shopping online.  I even need to buy wider shoes after this baby!

Maybe I feel like spending the money on all of these “fixes” for the baby and me will be my way of feeling like I’m “doing” something when I feel so unproductive and helpless - all of these weeks have been spent in survival mode and I’m a list-making planner type “do-er” person normally.

I’m super paranoid when it comes to putting the scoops in the bottle and putting the water right at the mark especially when I would be making bottles exhausted. And I also read reviews on the formula pro and it has a bunch about dehydrating babies or not distributing enough formula. I wanted to give it back to her but I don’t wanna be rude. I also was so excited for it that I opened it and set it up the day I got it and threw away the box so I know she can’t get a refund.

565,Having babies is about sacrifice,"So far in my almost 6 weeks of being a mum is that I've learnt I'm more willing to sacrifice everything for my baby than my partner. While he get to keeps to everything about himself like his hobbies, his friends and mental/emotional health I've basically put our child ahead of everything in my life and have lost my sense of self. 

I get my partner is currently the only one working but he doesn't understand the stress of being stuck at home with a child 24/7. We only have the one car which he takes to work everyday so I'm not able to travel or leave the house without him (we live out of town so I don't have access to public transport). I think I'm going stir crazy being locked up in a house for 6 weeks I've only left the house for short periods of time for doctors appointments for LO.  

I haven't seen any of my friends since I left the hospital and anytime I try to make plans they all bail last minute to come over or the activities aren't baby friendly and I can't go. The only interaction I get is with my partners family and him (I don't talk to mine.. it's a long story,). 

My hobbies that made me destress I'm not able to do anymore because I'm now the only one maintains our house, baby and our dog. He believes since I'm home all day he shouldn't have to worry about it ( all I ask is that he unloads or loads the dishwasher) but he all cares about is his video games and him being about to relax after work. 

I'm starting to really get frustrated at him for not helping out more where he could but all I get met with is him getting frustrated cuz his job is stressful and he deserves to relax when he gets home and his days off cuz he's the only one working now. We're doing fine financially. 

He just spends all his free time playing video games shut up in his games room from the hour he gets home to whebrver he goes to bed. He doesn't spend time with me unless it's something he wants to do. He won't even watch a TV show with me because it's not something he likes. I just want to have time with my partner that's not me spent watching him play games. It's driving me insane. 

He won't even hold our baby unless I hand her to him or if she's asleep than when he does he complains how heavy she is after a couple of minutes than hands her back. He doesn't even try bonding with her. 

I just want more help around the house. I want more support with our baby. I want more support from my partner supporting me when I need it. I need support from him when she's screaming for ages and nothing will soothe her. I need him to actually step up and grow up but when I bring it up with him he tells me he'll leave me if I don't drop the subject or he'll just say I'm being too emotional. 

And on top of all this my dog has recently died and now having to look after my partners dog days after mine has died I can't help feel distant from it as it's a dog my partner has had wayyy before we met and I know it's petty but I don't have the same connection with him as I did my own dog. And my dog was there for throughout my first miscarriage and he was there with me through a lot of struggles and hardship. 

I'm just feeling at the end of my rope. I'm just tired of acting like nothing bothers me anymore and I'm tired of having to act like im happy. I don't want to leave him but I'm just so fed up of acting like I can hold the world up on my own.",beyondthebump

570,Am I sucking at this parenting thing?,"So I will read books on what my 7 week old could be doing, or I'll see videos of moms who's babies are interactive or playing, or doing things at about the same age according to mother posting and I find it strange because:

1. my baby is usually fussy, dedicated tummy time ( not on my lap) pisses her off. Or she's not much responsive to let's say a rattle or a black and white stuffie outside of a face of confusion or terror. 

2. All she wants to do is sleep and poop. And most of the time outside of that, she cries, it's rare to see even a glimpse of something interesting ( like she coo-ed with interest at dad for doing bicycle legs ONCE). 

3. The closest activity I have found to do that she doesnt mind time to time is a walk/stroll.....while she sleeps.

I was told by pediatrician not to worry about it ( at 1 month appointment). But I cant help but wonder if my baby is being slow and if it's a bad thing. Am I being interactive enough or is baby affected on how tired I am. Will my baby ever show curiosity by reaching, not just staring? Should I not worry?

571,Wife is normal around baby and indifferent around me.,"Wife is normal with toddler and cold towards me when we are alone.

Wife and I are 33.  Happily married for several years.  Zero issues.  Have a toddler that is a year and a half old.  

TLDR: Since our child’s birth, my wife has been completely normal when she is around the baby and then extremely withdrawn when we are alone.  

At first, I thought this was normal mom behavior or mild PPD.   But it been well over a year now and she is no longer nursing.  Also, she did not have any other significant symptoms of PPD or overt signs of depression.  She is fine at work and enjoys engaging in whatever social activities we can safely do during covid.  She has an established group of girlfriends and family that she talks to routinely. 

Based on her otherwise normal behavior, I thought it might be normal relationship stress post-baby.  I went to counseling and determined that my best plan was to support her, keep reaching out, and be patient as she navigated her new normal.  

I have doubled down on efforts around the house and with baby responsibilities.  We both work from home and I feel good about my contributions for the last several months and she agrees.  But, the distance remains.  We have taken trips away from the baby and they have been great.  We had sex and enjoyed each other’s company. 

But, when back home she is gone from me. We have also taken trips with the baby and it’s the same as home.  

We have talked openly about these issues and she has agreed that we need to improve, but she thinks I am doom and gloom about the relationship and that we are fine.  I feel like she has fallen out of love with me  despite her honest desire not to and is unwillingly to admit it to herself.  Alternatively, I think she may actually have some form of PPD despite me writing it off earlier. 

Between my hurt feelings, anxiety about divorce, and need for self preservation, I 
have also fallen out of love with her and was considering divorce. But I want to fall back in love with her, am willing to put in the work, and believe we have all of the necessary ingredients for a successful marriage.  I asked her if she wanted a divorce and she said no. 

I have been asking for her to individually or jointly go to counseling with me, but she resists and keeps asking for more patience and time for us to keep trying.  I get the impression that she also honestly wants the relationship to succeed and views going to counseling as admitting that our problems are more severe than she wants to admit.  Obviously, I am working on overcoming that belief.

1.  If both parties are willing to hit restart   On a relationship, where do we start?  Is it just go out on dates and see where it goes?

2.  Is depression or PPD likely here?  The fact that she is only “down” when we are alone and how long this has been going on confuses me.",beyondthebump

My son was born in November and has only met his grandparents ONCE. 

Eaten in a restaurant? Once. Seen close friends? Twice. Met neighbors? Twice. And all in the last 3 months as people have been vaccinated. 

With cases rising again we will have to go back into “lockdown” mode in order to keep our son safe. We were just starting to dip our toes in the outside world and now we have to run back inside. No out-of-state visitors, no travel, no concerts, no fun. 

I’m so frustrated. I feel robbed of so many experiences. I feel robbed of time. I feel robbed of friends and family. I feel robbed of all of the special moments I could have shared with the people I love over the last 18 months. 

I worry about my son and everything he’s missed. I’m sad he hasn’t been able to meet new people and see the world. I worry about his development and how this will impact him as he grows. 

I hate this. My husband and I are not fearful people by nature, but safety is our top priority as parents. We just can’t justify taking unnecessary risks knowing how devastating it would be for any of us to get sick. 

I just want this to be over. I want my light at the end of the tunnel back. I want people to wear a mask. I want people to vaccinate. I want my life back, but most of all I just want people to take the recommendations seriously and stop politicking every decision and guideline.

580,Anyone been told how well the COVID vaccine/antibodies transmit through breast milk?,"I’ve brought it up with my pediatrician and I pretty much always get a hand wavy “oh yeah- all antibodies get through to make baby healthier”, but I’m looking for something more concrete. 

I hate breastfeeding. I never produced enough (or even close to) and put my body through torture trying to get there. My baby loves the bottle. Normally I’d just call it quits and decide to have an exclusive formula fed baby. But COVID makes me feel like I have to keep going to some extent. 

At this point I pump once in the morning and once at night and he gets less than 2 ounces of breast milk a day from that. The rest of the time he gets formula. 

Pumping absolutely kills my back. No matter where I sit or how I try to make it better, the angle I need to have gravity work with the pump makes my sciatica flare up so badly I can’t move some days. 

I do it because I feel like there has to be some benefits of antibodies he is getting so he can be at least a little protected from COVID (and other illnesses). But if there’s some study saying there’s a point where it just isn’t useful anymore, I’d love to know it so I won’t have to feel like I failed him if he did somehow manage to catch COVID. 

I did get the vaccine while I was pregnant, but there’s no studies that I can find that show how well or how long that can protect.

I know this is a bit paranoid, but my view is that it all seems over the top until the worst happens and you sit there wondering “was there more I could do?”

Some background:  was sleeping through the night, then the 4 month regression hit hard.  He was waking every 1-2 hours.  Days go by, it got a little better, we had some glimmers of hope, but right around 6 months it went back to bad sleep.  The current trend is right around 40-45 minutes, to the minute, he will flip over onto his belly and starts screaming.  Only way to get him back out is to shake him lightly and hold him for 5-10 minutes.  Then it happens all over again through the night.

We are doing everything we can routine wise.  Wife gives him a bath, lavender massage and then a bottle before bed.  He usually passes right out but only for that 45 minutes.  I’m assuming it’s him transitioning to the best sleep cycle.  Hoping it’s just another regression or maybe the leap he’s coming out of.

Anyone else deal with this?",beyondthebump
592,How did you overcome your trauma to be a more mindful parent?,"TW: physical abuse

Hello! I'm 36 weeks pregnant and have been thinking a lot about what kind of mama i want to be. I was raised with a periodically absent father (#navybrat) and a mother that was physically abusive and emotionally manipulative. My siblings got the worst of the physical abuse because I had a childhood surgery that put a stop to the belt for me around age 12. However, i was often woken up to the sound of my mom beating the shit out of my sister for staying up late to watch anime, among other things, until she moved out at 18. My family still communicates by shouting at each other. I have a vivid memory promising myself that I would never hit my own kids when I was 10 years old. 

My pregnancy was planned, and I've worked really hard to overcome much of my trauma before my husband and I decided to have kids. However, I'm worried about slipping into the habits of my mother and grandmother because it is all I really know. I have no personal examples of ""peaceful parenting.""

I tried to discuss this with my MIL, who is a retired teacher and is one of the most patient and supportive people I have ever met. She knows some of my background and has met my family multiple times. I mentioned to her that I want to practice peaceful parenting and Montessori methods, and that I dont want to be a parent that yells or spanks their kids. I was surprised when she pointed out that my BIL and his wife have moved on to a ""quick pat on the butt because time out doesnt work for them anymore"" with my 4 yo nephew. She supported this because ""different things work for different kids."" Now, maybe our definitions of yelling and spanking are different, but I am also a teacher who has worked with prek-8th grade and i don't believe in spanking at all. I wouldn't dream of putting my hands on my kids. 

So i guess my question really is, has my trauma made me jump to the other extreme of no spankings ever? Of course there will be discipline, but not with violence. Is it possible to have a ""healthy"" amount of spanking that I'm just not seeing? How did you find your groove as a parent with past trauma?",beyondthebump

In the process of getting ac fixed his schedule was thrown off and we hit a total sleep regression. He quit napping ( he’s never just fell asleep wherever it’s always been in his crib or dark room) and he started crying for hours and standing up in crib for hours holding on to rails while falling asleep. To make matters worse one week into this we had our DD. Now we have been home for 2 weeks. We have went back to the beginning with the Ferber method and we are on day 6. Somethings have gotten better. He has taken a few naps and sometimes crying is better, other nights it’s for 2 hours. He still stands in his crib until he cannot any longer.

I saw the pictures after pick up, so I couldn’t say anything to his teacher in the moment. However, he did sleep fairly long (an hour and ten minutes compared to his usual 40 minute naps at daycare).

He can roll over and push himself up on his belly really well, but still generally hates tummy time. Otherwise really good neck control and overall gross motor development.

Given all this, I’m wondering if it might be ok now to let him nap on his belly, especially if it’s going to help him get longer naps at daycare.

606,What was your epidural experience like?,"Trigger warning: traumatic birth

I have a three-year-old, and I'm currently 26 weeks pregnant with my second. The birth I experienced three years ago was traumatic -- the short story is that it was the most excruciatingly painful thing I've ever experienced. The slightly longer version is that I had high blood pressure, so my doc wanted to get the baby moving. Even though I wanted a natural birth and had done hypnobirthing training, the pitocin I ended up receiving ramped up my contractions to the point where I felt like a wild animal thrashing in pain. I got an epidural at 9cm that did nothing. 

So! This time around, I plan to get an epidural at the recommended 4-5cm mark... The catch is, I don't live in the US. I live in a South American country and my doctor here explained to me that when the time comes to push, they turn off the analgesic delivery (via the epidural) so that the woman can feel the contractions. And she says it WILL be painful. This scares me!

My daughter is 3 months old and I started back at work 3 weeks ago, while my husband stays home with her. She is refusing the bottle.

When I was trying again at 2 months before going back to work, she was refusing. Now it’s been weeks and when fed by my husband she will mostly toy with the bottle nipple for a half hour until she’s fed up and will start screaming. Rarely she latches and sucks, but that’s very temporary. She also refuses the bottle from me. 

Part of the issue might be my inconsistent work schedule. I’m very rarely out of the house for 8 hours and I spend a lot of time working from home. Most days I will spend half a day out and come back home to finish work. So what usually happens is LO refuses the bottle while I’m gone (screaming) and will eat when I’m home. I’ve thought about spending full days out of the house to try to get her to take the bottle, but it’s also torture for my poor husband with all the crying! Please help.",beyondthebump

625,Dreading all nap times!,"When and how did you get your baby to independently sleep for naps? My daughter is 15 weeks old now.  Around 6 weeks she stopped napping on her own in the crib. She, so far, has been a decent night time sleeper. We wake 1-2 times. Randomly she has slept through the night but that seems to have stopped.

Two weeks ago I went back to work part time and she has been at daycare MWF. They report she is napping, although not very long typically.  We stopped swaddling a few weeks ago - not because she’s turned over yet, but because I wanted to transition away from it before I started work vs. having to cold turkey stop once she started turning.  She still isn’t turning or really showing signs from what I can see, but approaching four months old at the end of the month. 

Right now, I can barely get her to stay asleep for more than 5-10 minutes in her crib most of the time. Drowsy but awake does not work. I do not feed her to sleep during the day, but I do at night (sometimes she isn’t quite asleep after feeding, but will still go down just fine due to sleep pressure). We have had minimal nighttime issues so far, but I’m kind of bracing for things to get worse with a four month sleep regression. She usually goes down at night without a pacifier, but cannot during the day unless she has one. Also loves motion, and we usually do one nap a day in the stroller each morning so I can get some exercise for myself and my pup, and just get out of the house.  

I don’t really know if letting her fall asleep on me then repeatedly putting her back in the crib to only sleep &lt;10 minutes all. day. long. is really productive. It ruins my day when I do this instead of just wearing or holding her for a nap. But I know we are probably at a time where it will be easier to break some habits now, I just am at a loss for how to do it. She will sometimes fall asleep with a hand on the chest in her crib, but still wakes up soon after. The longer it goes on, the more overtired she gets and the harder and harder it is to soothe her without letting her fall asleep on me, which sets us back. Of note, I’m not really wanting to sleep train for awhile, so crying it out is not an option for us right now. 

Admittedly, I love and have gotten used to the daily cuddles myself, but I’m torn with wanting to continue this and also wanting to help her nap well at daycare and at home. Any advice or commiseration is welcome :)",beyondthebump

I am on a strict elimination diet (eating only lamb, cassava, cauliflower, olive oil and this adult elemental formula which tastes disgusting for nutrition purposes only) and it is taking a toll on my health after several months. I am having GI issues, losing too much weight, have a weird rash, my joints hurt, and so on. We finally trialed several formulas and found one that works - Kabrita goat milk formula. It has been so incredibly hard to get her to take it though. It’s not the formula taste, she likes it. But she prefers nursing. We tried many different sippy and straw cups (she won’t take a bottle anymore due to aversion). She just loves being on the breast. I’m not gonna lie I sob and sulk for hours after denying her the breast. She cries and lunges for my breast and doesn’t understand. Any time she needs comfort that always soothes her and so when she gets upset I have to just walk away and leave her like that. It breaks my heart. On top of that she is teething and likes my breast for comfort when shes not feeling well. I am having second thoughts now about switching to formula. It just doesnt feel right to me. She does well on my breastmilk so long as I am on this ridiculous diet. I could of course consider adding more foods to my diet but that requires a trial and potentially putting her through a bad reaction flare up and that can last up to a week. There is no easy answer.

631,Best way to get rid of the binky?,"My son (14 months) has gone from getting up to party every night to sleeping somewhat consistently through the night. The only problem is that he can’t find his binky and cries until I replace it. It’s time for it to go. We have been limiting it to nap/bedtime only, so no usage throughout the day, but my question is, should we just go cold turkey? I feel like since he’s already not using it during the day it’s our only real shot at getting him off it. Thoughts?",beyondthebump
632,I feel like a horrible mother and I am so overwhelmed,"This past weekend has been a literal s**t show. My MIL was watching my daughter and had put her down for a nap sideways while swaddled. My husband and I had told her multiple times not to do that and to only put her down to sleep on her back. Shortly after, I heard faint grunting noises kind of like she was struggling to breath and I find hr on her stomach flipped over. I immediately flip her onto her back and the grunting stops. But some it was so early in the morning I failed to check on her to assess her colourings etc. I realized later what a frikin terrifying thing that just occurred and worried not about oxygen deprivation or asphyxiation. 

Last night, our AC broke and the house was around 25c. My daughter started crying inconsolably and nothing we did could stop her crying. She would eat and then vomit her milk and after a while, she stopped crying and went silent just staring at me and then closed her eyes. I foolishly thought I somehow comforted her and that’s why she stopped crying but now I think it was due to heat exhaustion or heat stoke. I was able to wake her up by taking off her onesie. We took her rectum temp and it was 37.2c so it wasn’t a fever but she was running hot.  This morning she vomited up her milk again. 

We’re taking her to the paediatrician today (closed on the weekend) and can only hope everything is okay. I’m so scared because she’s only 3 weeks old.",beyondthebump

635,BIL ignoring my baby and he has a favorite baby,"My BIL (16 yrs old) has been ignoring my baby since day 1. His excuse is because my baby is a ""cry baby"" and doesn't like my baby. My other BIL (25 yrs old) also has a baby and his baby is just 1 month older than mine. My younger BIL loves the other baby and always excited to talk and see him every day. While he has been ignoring my baby..

I told my partner about and he's been telling me that he'll talk to his younger brother about it. He talked to him about it once last month and the younger BIL didn't respond and still ignoring my baby.

Tbh, whenever the younger BIL wants to talk to me I just nod or reply with one sentence. I really cried once because my in-laws' favorite is the other baby, and one time I left my baby for a few minutes and then I saw my baby all by herself looking at the ceiling. While the other baby is being around my MIL and younger BIL. It fucking hurts.

There is also one time my baby's eyes are following my younger BIL and he straight up ignored my baby! He literally slide and talk to the other baby.

And yesterday my baby is playing alone on her rocking chair while the other baby is being talked by my MIL and younger BIL. I also cried last night because of that.

This is a shitty feeling. My partner said my BIL is just shy. And he's being bullied at school. In my opinion, he's also bullying my baby by ignoring her! What if she can understand now and will ask us why her uncle is ignoring her and just playing with another baby?

I understand he's young and still a child. But why does he hate my baby just because she's a cry baby? It's normal for babies to cry! Ffs!!

637,A poem from your LO,"I found this.(come back and read after your meeting not before)  Needed to share with you.  When you're stressed and tired, Remember how much they love you.

""Do you know that feeling when you wake up in the middle of the night and it’s cold and your diaper feels heavy. And there are so many strange sounds all around you, and it’s dark and scary. And you get a hit in your head and it’s your hand that’s on its own adventure. And you can’t control it at all and it flings itself around and scratches your face and pulls at your hair. 

And your legs start kicking off the duvet, even though you’re cold as it is and you try to make it stop but they have their own will. And so you’re lying there completely helpless with flailing limbs that want to do everything, but none of the things you want.

And you can’t find mom. And you call for her and you find yourself feeling really scared. What if your beloved mom doesn’t come for you. You can’t imagine anything worse and you start to cry because you miss her so terribly. You have never felt as alone as this very moment.

And then she is suddenly there. Standing right by your bed and looking at you with worry and love. And she is the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. And you grin up at her with happiness and relief. You don’t think you’ve ever felt as happy as this very moment.

And she picks you up and holds you close. And she smells like herself, and also a bit like you. Like milk and safety and love. And it’s the best smell in the whole entire world.

And she is warm and safe and soft and her hands caress you and she feeds you and hums your favourite tune. And you love her voice. You’ve known it far longer than you’ve really known her. It has lulled you to sleep and made you laugh and calmed you when you were distressed. It is the most beautiful voice in the whole entire world. 

And you get to lie right up against her and you feel your entire body start to warm up again. And your still cold hand starts stroking her and moves up towards her neck and accidentally scratches her. Stupid uncontrollable hand. But mom doesn’t get angry. She takes your stupid hand in hers and it turns all warm again.  And this is the best feeling in the world. Right here in mommy’s arms, with your hand in hers. 

And you feel your eyes getting heavy and you know that everything is okay now cause mommy is here. Your mom. Your wonderful, incredible mom who always looks after you. Night and day. 
You look up at her one last time before you fall asleep. She looks tired and her eyes are closed, and yet she is still the most magnificent thing you know. How amazing that she wants to sit here with you in this moment. How amazing that she will always sit with you for a bit when you need her to.

You smile to yourself. How lucky you were that she became your mom. The most perfect mom anyone could have asked for.

You knew, even before you saw her, that she would be the best thing in the world.

Oh how you love her. Your mom.❤️""",beyondthebump
638,Toddler won’t eat in highchair,"As the title says, my 14 month old doesn’t want to eat in her highchair. If she sees me standing at the kitchen counter, sitting at the table, or on the couch eating something, she’ll come over and want some. I’ll give her a bite and she comes back for more over and over - no matter what it is. But whenever I put her in the highchair for meals, she just plays and throws it on the floor. Very little ends up in her mouth. She’s not a picky eater so I’m not sure what the issue is. 

I’ve tried changing up meal times a little to be sure she’s not tired and sitting her at the table instead of her highchair, but not much difference. 

She’s a small kid to begin with and has always been a little behind on her weight so I’m concerned about her not eating enough.

Some nights are great with 8 straight hours of sleep and only one wake up to feed. Other times, like the past two nights, she’s up twice. We let her fuss a little before going into her room and attempt to comfort her first to try to get her to soothe back to sleep. But oftentimes we end up just feeding her. I’m assuming babies will be babies and inconsistency is normal. The pediatrician told us that at this age, one nighttime feeding is normal, so is twice not normal?

641,Eating tips!,"LO is 6 months old and we’ve been trying to feed her purées. So far we’ve tried:

Peas
Sweet potato
Apple
Mango
Pear
Carrot
Beef
Baby cereal

(We did each one for 3 days and then started the next)

But she doesn’t like having a spoon in her mouth. I know she likes some of the foods because once its in her mouth she “chews” and swallows it, but she always turns her head and keeps her mouth shut when I try to feed her. 

I’ve tried different spoons, letting her feed herself, putting it on her hands and she just won’t eat it.

643,How to get baby to eat more?,"I have a 12 week old who seems to be a serial snacker. He tends to eat 2-3 ounces at a time, and my pediatrician and the internet are both telling me he could be eating 5-6 ounces at a time. After a couple ounces though, he'll just start playing with the bottle and spitting it out, or filling up his mouth and just letting it run out and smiling really big like it's hilarious. We burp him a lot, every couple ounces or so, and sometimes he will take another ounce after that, but not often. I would like to see if him taking bigger bottles might give us some longer stretches sleeping at night. He's gaining weight and growing and everything fine, he's 95th percentile for length and 75th for weight, so it's not his total intake I'm worried about, I'm just hoping for more at a time.

647,9 months eczema baby and sleep,"I would love to hear about other people's experiences - my baby just turned nine months and I am getting whiplash from being torn between giving it time and letting him figure things out on his own, or resorting to some form of sleep training (preferably the gentlest one):

He does the typical short naps (right now a hot 35 minutes, twice a day), and has on average two night wakings, one at midnight, one around 4am (sometimes he miraculously has only one, and sometimes he will be restless around 10pm, but otherwise he's pretty consistent). So, not great, but doable for all involved so far... - He falls asleep either after nursing, or being rocked, and his crib is attached to our bed, side-car style. Basically, the opposite of that famous independent sleep.

The big caveat is that he has had severe eczema from about 4 months, and we have just gotten it somewhat under control (through creams, strict dietary changes and a host of other measures), but the itch is still there, and it is very strong at night when he is awake or half-asleep, when he will rub his face until the skin is hot and irritated, no matter how many layers of mittens he sports. - So far we've managed to avoid this by nursing or rocking him to sleep.

Has anyone been in the same situation? Did your baby outgrow this phase on their own and learn independent sleep? Or are we setting ourselves up for far worse after the next regression, or when he gets too heavy for rocking?

I don't know what to think anymore: My partner and I would hate to have to resort to CIO, we would be so worried about the damage he could do to his skin on top of the crying. We hope he will outgrow his eczema over time, but I don't know whether we still need to get him to learn to fall asleep sometime soon, or whether we even can, given his skin condition. I've read Precious Little Sleep, The No-Cry Sleep Solution, I've read about Ferber and co... But I don't know how to apply any of what I've read to our situation...",beyondthebump

Currently, my LO gets fed to sleep for his first sleep of the night where he does a 3-4hr stretch, then feed sleep, feed sleep, feed sleep cycle until the morning where we introduce feed play sleep.

I haven’t been able to sleep much at all at night and the world has started to be gray in the mornings. I’m finding it harder to engage with my son sometimes. I know that it’s the drop in hormones, and I need to find a therapist to help me work thru this better than stumbling alone and if needed try medication. 

Any tips on finding a phone therapist that specializes in postpartum? I’m staying with my in-laws atm, and they are in a very rural area so I can’t look in my area. Also any tips for me to manage some of the effects on my own?

652,My son has dropped off the weight-for-age curve,"I'm just absolutely shattered and exhausted. I feel so guilty and like I failed as a mum. I have tried so hard and I just don't know what to do anymore. 

Doctors/midwives/pediatricians have all just said.. do nothing.. just monitor. It's behavioural they say. just keep monitoring since he's hitting all his milestones, he's active, high energy, and happy. But I'm scared. It's scary seeing him lose weight. It gives me anxiety when everyone makes comments about how small he is. He's 19 months old and only weighs 8.7kg. When I pick him up I can feel his ribs. He's just so little. 

I managed to keep him at the 5th percentile for a while using the iPad and spoon feeding him and giving him a bottle of formula before bed. But I was told by the GP and midwives to stop all formula, stop the iPad and let him feed on demand - I've followed all advice and none of it has improved his eating habits and he has continued to drop in percentiles and now he's not even on the curve. 

What do I do? He's interested in eating sometimes. He asks me for food but he doesn't really finish anything. Just takes small bites and finishes tiny portions. He won't sit for dinner and runs around even if we model eating. He won't stay in the chair. If we clip him in he keeps cries and throws his plate on the floor and doesn't eat anyway. 

I've tried cooking noodles/ soups/ rice/ muffins/ pancakes/ smoothies/ wraps. And it's so frustrating to see it all in the bin 

Ive had trouble feeding him since he was a baby. I dread every meal time and snack time. I feel like I need help and advice and the medical professionals aren't really giving me any.",beyondthebump

657,Overcoming anxiety around something bad happening to my baby,"A few days ago, I went to get my vaccine at a drive-thru site. After getting the shot, they make you wait in your car for 15 minutes to make sure you don’t have a reaction. You are asked to turn your car off. I had my baby in his car seat in the back, and after a few minutes I felt like it was getting a little warm. I looked back and saw that I had left a blanket over his legs, so I removed it. Normally, something like this would either wake him up or cause him to stir at least a bit, but he didn’t move or make a sound. I asked my mom who was in the passenger seat if she could quickly get out and check on him as his car seat was in the back seat on her side. I accidentally locked the door instead of unlocking it when she got out to check, and as she tried to open his door, she looked in through the window and gasped and yelled at me to open the door. I unlocked the door and she was screaming my babies name and frantically trying to get him out of the car seat, and a nurse ran over asking what was happening. He was just asleep, but I guess his head was slightly slumped over and it caused my mom to panic and think something was wrong. 

I don’t fault her for her reaction, but it was so traumatizing thinking for even a split second that something had happened to him. I felt ashamed because I didn’t even move to get out of the car, I was just frozen in place. I worry that if something was truly happening, I wouldn’t be able to react in time. But beyond that, my anxiety has been through the roof in the days since. I’m constantly on edge that he’s not breathing, when he’s out of sight/with his dad in another room I panic at the slightest sound thinking he was dropped, and I can’t stop thinking about the possibility of losing him.

We have 200 active cases (we are in the red) we have breakthrough cases, 50 plus kids positive ans we have had one vaccinated death all in the last week. 

School starts the 11th. They are not requiring masks, nor social distancing and have took down all safety measures from last year, like dividers at the lunch tables. Board of education said its up to parent if the kid wears a mask or not. 

My county has a large number of anti masks, anti vaccine mindset. 

We also have a county fair being held on the 12 thru the 14th and I know every kid in this county will be packed in there like sardines shoulder to shoulder.

Well we went to urgent care anyways and long story short after a long night of mostly waiting and no answers we were sent home to see our dr Friday who sent us off to the ER immediately to get blood work done. We did and then were admitted into the hospital, the blood work came back that she has a bacterial infection, they called it septic arthritis. Her foot was very swollen and red so she had to go into orthopedic surgery for them to irrigate and clean it out (the cultures came back that it’s in the staph family, which exact one we’ll know tomorrow). She’s on an iv for antibiotics and she’s recovering really well from everything but she’s going to be here for at least a few days. 

The doctors have told us repeatedly that bringing her in right away was the absolute right and best thing to do. With an infection like this it needs to be treated immediately. Honestly as a ftm I don’t know what I’m doing. My first instinct is of course, we have to take her to the dr. But I hate that there was even a moment of doubt not to.

If someone is vaccinated idk why they care about what others. Your chances of getting it, having bad symptoms from it, and death are way lower apparently then if you weren’t vaccinated.

But I am seeing the news on the variants, offices delaying people coming back, mask mandates etc and am now worried we won’t have that same option. Is this a dumb move? I’ve wanted to leave minnesota for years but now with a kid (and frankly a  never ending pandemic) I don’t know if it’s the right choice. We have a short window to back out which is making it harder!

673,I despise antivaxxers and antimask moms.,"I had to cancel my trip to attend my friend’s wedding, and I had to tell another friend who was planning to come visit us that we can’t have her come because our son is not vaccinated yet.

Delta variant has been going up and there’s still no vaccines for 3 years old. And the local mom groups are full of antivaxx antimask moms that are complaining about the school district mandating mask. And they are like “it’s my body my choice” “freeeedommm” but you guys affect other people. Bunch of selfish a-holes who thinks wearing a mask indoor is going to kill them.

What a foolish society we are in. I despise them completely, I’m just so tired of this shit. It could have been over if they got vaccinated. Wear mask. But noooooo.

She started breathing again and I made sure she was okay, then she spit up a ton all over both of us. I think she had to spit up and it just went down the wrong way but it scared the absolute crap out of me. Once I knew she was okay I cried and called my mom.

684,Feeling overwhelmed and like I ruined my life…,"As of yesterday, I am 7 weeks pp. I love my daughter and she is in no way the reason I feel like I’ve ruined my life. There’s just a lot of transition going on right now and I don’t think I’ve made the best decisions and I’ve plagued by crippling anxiety that my life is now ruined.

A little background: For the past year, my spouse and I were living with my grandparents after COVID prematurely forced us to return from a year-long trip around the world (supposed to be our last “hurrah” before kids and buying a house). When we returned, we moved into their basement, which was basically set up like a small apartment sans a kitchen, found good jobs, starting saving again, and got pregnant with our daughter. While I really got along with my grandparents, the living situation was occasionally challenging for a few factors. One being that their property is set up like a family compound, with my mom and her husband living in a trailer next to the house and my uncle and cousin living in a converted tuff shed on the edge of the property. There was often a lot going on with so many people and it could feel chaotic. Also, both my husband and I work from home and his basement office space had no windows and was incredibly loud from all the activity happening above him. He was miserable with that office set up but was able to make it work.

The plan was always to buy a house and we have been looking since December with little luck. We live in the Pacific Northwest where it’s particularly expensive and competitive. In May, my husband found a small house in my second preferred location that he loved. I liked it ok but definitely didn’t love it. At the time though, it was the best thing we’d seen in awhile, so we made an offer. We didn’t get it, but we’re chosen as the backup offer.

Fast forward a few weeks later and the original buyers pull out due to a change in their finances. Even while under contract, I was starting to second guess buying a house. While it’s beautiful and bright and airy (a departure from living in the basement) it’s small and I think our offer was too high. Husband and family encouraged me to go forward with it and the house appraised at our offer (which I actually disagree with based on comps I’ve seen). 

Now we are in our house and I miss my chaotic family and even the basement. I’m convinced we paid too much for this house and the market is going to crash and we’ll be trapped here forever and/or become destitute. I’ve been obsessing over this and can’t stop looking at Zillow and reading articles about the housing market. And while my husband and I lived together for years just the two of us before moving in my grandparents, we haven’t lived alone with a baby. Part of me thinks I’m crazy for leaving my family (with minimal housing costs) and I’m feeling lonely and wondering if we can do this.

I’m starting to drive my husband crazy— he’s been clear that he can’t continue to have the same conversations and hash up the past. To his point, we are both in our early and mid 30s respectively, educated, with good jobs and should be living alone as a family unit. I’m just feeling anxious and resentful that I’m living in a house I don’t love and paying a premium to do so. I keep thinking we should have stayed in our basement and now our financial future is ruined by buying a house. I also miss the support of my family. They’re only 20 minutes away and I see them a few times a week but that’s still less convenient than living in on the property.

I’m in therapy and taking medication but still feel like this anxiety crippling. I feel trapped and overwhelmed. Any insight/words of wisdom appreciated.

Tl;dr: new mom and just bought a house I don’t love, moved out of my family’s house and feeling anxious/overwhelmed and like I’ve ruined my life.",beyondthebump

694,New mom looking for career advice,"As title says, I'm looking for any guidance or perhaps input on your own experiences regarding baby/career. I know ultimately I'll have a better idea of what to do when I go back to work in November, but until then I'd love to hear from other people similar to me...

I very much consider myself a career woman. I have a lot of my identity / pride tied into what I do for a living. So working and having a job I enjoy is a huge thing for me. The last dept I worked in, I hated, and if affected my personal life significantly because of it. That being said, that was also in part due to rotating day/night shifts and untreated bipolar disorder. I also didn't have a kid then lol. Anyways!

My 3 options basically consist of choosing 2 of the 3: Financial security, Time with my child, and Job happiness. 

I currently work part time at my job (four eight hour shifts per week) this results in an extra day off with baby, and I keep the job I LOVE doing. However we barely come out ahead because of this and will likely be just breaking even each month. So Job happiness and Time with child. 

My 2nd option is going back to my current position full time. This will make my benefits go down (FT benefits are 800 and PT benefits are 1200 a month) so I will have Financial security and keep the Job happiness, but I will lose that extra day off with baby. Also worth noting I have to take call for my job, so out of the 8 weekend days in a month I only truly have 6 of them off work. 

Option 3 is to go to our competitor hospital part time, whose benefits are literally 50% of what I am paying now (I got the rates from someone currently working there) and pay more per hour, but I don't know that I would find a job that I love there. I can tolerate a job that I don't hate, but I like to be stimulated/challenged, so it's hard to imagine leaving what I consider to be my current dream job. So Financial security and time with child.

Going on my husbands or the states insurance is not an option cause they're both equal to or more than what I'm paying now for less coverage. 

It's hard because no matter which way I slice it I have to make a sacrifice somewhere and I don't know what to do. I'm trying not to fixate too much but it's making me very anxious. Thoughts?

699,2 months PP and partner cheated on me.,"It happened. I didn't think it would, I didn't think this is something I would have to worry about. I've been severely suffering from PPD/PPA, and I just found out my partner has been cheating on me. I spent weeks glancing over his shoulder trying to figure out his password, I spent weeks trying to tell myself he is being faithful, I don't need to do this, we are happy and we are trying. 

I figured out his password and went through his phone. I found messages between him and some girl with a hidden name using initials. Telling her he wants to sneak over, touch her inappropriately (ew..), cuddle, and drink with her. He proceeded to say he will take any chance he gets, to get away from the house, because ""it's like I work for her but I don't get paid, and I don't get laid"". He planned to go to her house at 5pm, and after looking at our past messages on that day/time I was texting him asking when he would be home from work. I was having a very hard day, our baby was very fussy, he had already been working 12 hours. He told me it would be a long day, he was busy, and would hopefully be home soon. Hours went by, he came home from ""work"" at 12:30am, hours of me texting and calling wondering what was going on. After reading the messages, I now know he was at this girls house. While we were sitting at home waiting for him. More messages showed that he apparently had her house keys, and was sneaking over for awhile. I guess he was busy with his ""family"" for too long, and she started demanding her house keys back. He left to run an ""errand"" which turns out, was returning her house keys. This girl knows about me and our baby, she knew we were at home while he was doing this. She has a kid. I'm so shocked I can barely function. He also offered another girl 500$ to do inappropriate things to her. 

I can't believe this is happening. I feel so bad for my baby girl, I don't know what we are going to do. This is my main place for support and I needed to get this out. My heart is broken, I'm in such a dark place. I thought everything was okay, I thought he was being supportive through my struggles. I thought he loved me. My baby girl's smile is the only thing getting me through the difficult days right now, I hope she knows her mom is trying so hard to find happiness through this. I hope she knows that her and I will be okay, no matter what happens.",beyondthebump

701,Newborn has issues with eating (formula fed) + falling and staying asleep. Any advice would do!,"My LO is 17 days today and is mainly formula fed. For the 3-4 last days and nights she has been wanting a lot of milk. I thought this might be a growth spurt period, but she has a very weird pattern when eating now. When she is very hungry (for example when waking up in the noght), she eats quite well until the worst hunger has subsided. She will keep wanting a pacifier or the bottle, but spits both of them out and show that she is clearly unhappy. If she falls asleep, she will stay asleep for maybe 10-15 minutes before she wants more food. But when we give her the bottle, she will repeat the same pattern. She does the same thing with the pacifier top. This results in her being fussy a lot and sleeping much less than normal. She was a little constipated for the first week after we came home from the hospital, so we changed her formula and now she poops, farts and burps normally, from what we know. Could this still be an issue with gas? We have a hard time getting her to sleep, the worst is trying to get her to sleep in her own bed or our bed. When she finally falls asleep, it is usually in the baby nest or in her stroller. These have softer matresses than the beds. Could this mean that she has trouble with her muscles or neck? She clearly prefers tilting her head to the left. She makes some sounds on her sleep that sounds like she is uncomfortable, like a groan every 5-10 minutes.

Last night I tried putting her down ""drowsy but awake"" like all of the literature says to do, but she cried for 3+ hours, fell asleep for two hours, and woke back up. I stayed beside the crib with her the entire time, patted/rubbed her belly/back, rocked the crib, nothing worked. She was also in her crib for the first time, the three nights before my MIL had her overnight in her in her bassinet in the guest room. 

I think she needs to sleep in her crib every night with us there from now on. No MILs, no guest rooms, etc. We need to keep working on the ""drowsy but awake"" thing. Here's the issue: MIL lives 3 hours (4/5 with baby though) away, and my husband wants to stay with her every other weekend, at least during the summer (she lives at the beach).

I'm torn. On one hand, we can get solid sleep when we go there, and spend the weekends at the beach while MIL watches the baby. On the other hand, will her sleep improve when her routine is being thrown off every other weekend? She does sleep most of the way in the car, but we don't get home until around 9/10pm, so way past her 8pm bed time. Plus now she's sleeping in a different room/crib again, with a different night caregiver. 

What would you do?",beyondthebump
710,Ten month old suddenly doesn’t want to be put down,"My nearly 10 month old is and has always been quite independent. She’s been quite content playing by herself with check in from me. We nurse, so she has lots of cuddles and whatnot. She rarely cries and has been this way from birth. 

That is, until the last ten days or so. Suddenly, she’ll whine and cry if my husband or I try to put her down. It’s usually do-able if just I’m with her (I can usually distract her with some thing), but if my husband or I need to switch who’s holding the baby, she has a really hard time with it (especially coming to me from him, even though I’m her primary caretaker. She really, really likes him). 

I honestly don’t know if it’s teeth (she never lets me look—again, very independent baby. It’s possible I saw a canine poking through [no molars yet]) or a separation anxiety thing or what. I don’t think it’s an ear infection just based on what I see in her behavior.

Anyways, any ideas or experience? Should I just baby wear her? I’ve always heard that you can’t spoil a newborn but she’s not exactly a newborn anymore…haha. Tips and advice appreciated!",beyondthebump
711,Gift ideas for wife returning to work?," My wife and I welcomed a baby girl back in March and we have both been working from home since her arrival. I will not have to go back into the office until January, but my wife is a teacher and will have to go back in the classroom in two weeks. 

She is heartbroken about having to leave our LO. If it wasn’t a financial strain, I would simply tell her to stay at home. As I write this, I realize there is not a gift that will replace the time she will be missing out on, but I want to do something to encourage her and lift her spirits for this next chapter. 

She has been a rockstar! I just want to make her first day back special even though I am pretty sure she will breakdown on the way to work. 

So far, I have thought about a new workbag and fill it with teacher things she may need, maybe a journal that says, “best mom ever” and write her a nice note on how grateful I am. Flowers from our LO on the first day? Hmm.. that may make her cry too. 

Any ideas are welcomed but I also accept positive energy for my wife as I am sure some of you can relate.",beyondthebump
712,17 month old not sleeping through the night anymore,"Our 17 month old son started sleeping through the night at 2 months old and didn’t have any problems with it (outside of teething and the random days here and there). For the past 2 months though, he’s been waking up in the middle of the night and most nights, refusing to go back to sleep for hours. We did move into a new house a few weeks ago and it got worse, but he was still having trouble before the move. At the old house, he still slept in the same room as us due to not having another option. After a week and a half of him keeping us up all night, we gave in and started putting him in bed with us because it was the only way that he would (most of the time) go back to sleep, but that’s not working anymore either. 

He just cut his eye teeth within the last 2 weeks, but even orajel and the occasional dose of Tylenol didn’t help him stay asleep. I’ve thought about talking with his doctor about melatonin at his 18 month visit, but any advice would be appreciated! I definitely haven’t ruled out that we made a dire mistake with letting him form a bad sleep habit, but we’re not sure where to go from here being as it’s our first child.",beyondthebump

714,"Baby has bronchiolitis, maybe from RSV :(","Our 7 week old's sister has picked up a nasty virus at nursery and been coughing everywhere at home, so there's no chance that baby wouldn't pick it up. First she had a snuffly snotty nose for a couple of days, we've been hooking out greenish snot. Then she developed a wet sounding cough - she was coughing about 3 times after first being sat up or picked up from lying down. No temperature, but she was losing interest in food a bit.. breastfeeding sessions became very short, like 2-5 minutes, and the amount of formula she drank went down from her usual 600ml a day to 450ml a day. (It's very useful logging all this stuff in our app to see patterns!). 

I rang the GP who said babies with older siblings will sadly pick up viruses, that no temperature was a good sign there was no infection, and that the cough didn't sound concerning as it wasn't continuous, just positional - ie it was only when she was first sat up. He said the chestiness was from mucus due to post nasal drip, and that there was nothing much to do except saline nasal drops for the snottiness. He said it might take a week or even 2 to clear, but to call again if it worsened. I mentioned she seemed to be puffing and breathing a bit faster (although it's hard to tell, she always seems huffy and fast), and he said babies should breathe about 40 times a minute. I timed her and she was 45 when awake, less when peacefully sleeping. We didn't see the GP in person due to covid - appointments are just by telephone unless they feel it warrants in-person assessment.

Baby was drowsier than normal the rest of that day, and slept longer blocks (3 hours rather than 1-2 - it's never been so easy to get her to nap!). We had a playground trip and baby was very sleepy and pallid in the face, dark around the eyes and slightly purple lips. She's had baby acne on her face and chest for weeks but she had a worse dry red rash on her cheeks around where the baby acne is. I don't know if it was just that she was so pale that the acne stood out more - either way her skin was a bit rough and dry. 

By the evening her cough seemed a little worse, 5 or 6 coughs together instead of 3, and more often, rather than only when first sat up. But by no means continuous, and she was sleeping quite peacefully. Still no temperature, it was 37.2 at highest, and breathing still about 40 times a minute which is as expected. But she seemed to be having a harder time of breathing, the muscles were drawing in under her rib cage (either side at the top of her stomach). She only had 350ml formula by evening and virtually no breastfeeding. She had dark circles around her eyes and I was trying to tell if she had sunken eyes by googling it and looking at older photos of her to compare..they seemed a little more indented around the nose and the eyelids looked a bit more prominent. She still had about 5 wet nappies in the day, of which 2 were big liquid poop blowouts. 

I couldn't tell if she was just wiped out from a cold but I wanted someone to see her in person. I rang 111 (non emergency care, as the GP was shut for the weekend - why is it always evenings/weekends when you need to talk to your doctor?!), and the symptom they were most concerned about was the chest muscle retractions and slight puffing to breathe. They sent an ambulance (not rushing with its lights on, it wasn't an emergency), and the paramedics said it was worth going to hospital for a proper review by a paediatric doctor, as they weren't baby specialists and there was only so much they could do in the field. 

Their main concern in hospital were O2 saturation levels. They struggled to get readings from her cold feet so had to warm her feet up for a while, but then reads were 90-95% which they were happy with. There was one dip to 86% and they considered oxygen but didn't use it in the end. They weren't overly worried about dehydration, because she was still having some wet nappies, she had tears when she cried, and her fontanelle wasn't indented. She did have slightly sunken eyes but that didn't seem to be their key metric to worry about, since other signs were ok. 

Her pulse was 169 which is the high end of normal for a 2 month old. They listened to her chest and said she sounded fluidy and a bit crackly on one side but that air flow was good. They diagnosed bronchiolitis (different from bronchitis), due to all the nasty viruses going around which would normally be winter viruses but have been suppressed by lockdowns.. there's been an unseasonally big surge in RSV which made it onto BBC news recently. In a small baby it's more concerning.

They sent her home after a few hours with a feeding plan, 60ml every 3 hours (on average), based on her weight and usual intake, and things to watch out for - few wet nappies (less than 1 in 8 hours), a high temperature, cyanosis, any general worsening. They said it should resolve by itself without medical intervention, although it may get worse before it gets better as symptoms tend to peak about day 4-5. So for now we're just waking her up to have milk little and often, and monitoring intake, wet nappies and temperature.

A bit long, but hopefully useful if someone is searching for info! By no means take our experience / doctor's advice as the only way it can present, or relevant to all cases, speak to your own doctor :)",beyondthebump
715,Pacifier weaning?,"My 4 month old son only uses a pacifier to soothe him to sleep and I'm starting sleep training right now and wondering whether or not to let him keep using the pacifier or not. 

I've read about how many people say you should start weaning at 6 months and fully by the first year but I've also read people's stories about how they don't wean and some have 2 year olds still using a pacifier. I'm very curious to hear both sides. 

I guess for some, pacifier weaning isn't synonymous with sleep training but my son only uses the pacifier to help him sleep so if I sleep train him without it, essentially I would be weaning and I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that sweet sweet sleep just yet. 

So tl;dr I'd love to hear about parents who've weaned their kids off pacifiers and at what age and why, and also from parents who didn't, how old their child is, and why they decided against weaning. Thanks!",beyondthebump
716,1 year old has a bad cold and I feel so helpless,"I have baby ibuprofen and paracetamol, antihistamines for his puffy eyes and clogged sinuses on recommendation from the pharmacist, a nose Frida, baby Vicks and saline spray. I'm getting a mist/steam diffuser in a few days once finances allow it (because stocking up on everything else he needs broke my budget for the week). And the cuddles, all the cuddles. 

He's moderately okay during the day, he's still a crazy little human hurricane, just more snotty and puffy eyed than normal. He's eating and drinking okay, not the best but he's doing what he can manage. He's having an extra nap or two to catch him up on the sleep he's losing at night. 

At night it's a different story. He's waking up every hour in hysterics because his little nose and sinuses are getting so backed up so quickly. I think he's getting sore ears from the sinus pressure. He can't nurse or take bottles well because he's so backed up and the nose Frida can't get all the mucus (and he hates anything near his nose so using it is a battle). Most of the time the baby Vicks is useless because his nose is so blocked. I have a firm pillow to prop him up on but he's a tummy sleeper so the moment I lay him down after being settled back to sleep, he rolls over and his sinuses get clogged again because of gravity. He's running a temperature on and off so I'm constantly adjusting his clothes to keep him at a good temperature. 

This is night #3 of this. I'm exhausted and doing this alone. I can't sleep because I'm either too anxious about his breathing or woken up 15 minutes after I fall asleep by my poor, sore, uncomfortable and distressed baby. I don't know what else I can do to help him, I just wanna wave a magic wand and get him back to his healthy, happy self. 

The soonest doctor's appointment is in two days time and I'm so worried about the yuckiness travelling to his lungs and making his breathing more difficult. Is there anything else I can do for him in the meantime? Any home remedies I can try to help clear things up?",beyondthebump

They show signs of readiness, the biggest being going into their play tent or a private area to poop. They also recognize when they have, we ask them if they’ve pooped and they shake their heads yes and point at their bum. They cannot recite ABCs.. but very insistent on what they want and can communicate such.

She woke up automatically at 5:00pm on the dot by herself. I talked to her a bit and layed her down on our bed. Not super close to the edge. I’ve always put her about that far away and she’s NEVER fallen off by herself like this. I went to go pee a few meters away, and I heard super loud screaming suddenly. I came back into the bedroom and she was laying on the floor!! I was so shocked and upset. I picked her up immediately and comforted her and she calmed down after a few minutes but immediately screamed if I tried putting her down again. 

Eventually she stopped and I could put her back down and she seems fine. She’s babbling and laughing and like normal. The bed is luckily very close to the ground, maybe a tiny bit more than a foot off the ground. 

She’s 15 weeks, but has never even come remotely close to rolling at all. She’s never seemed interested even when I tried to help her roll over. I’m so freaked out now. Maybe I should have known better because of her age but she’s seriously never shown any signs of rolling. Guess I have to work on transitioning her from the arms up swaddles now.

727,Husband disappointed in my breasts after pregnancy,"Where do I begin. I have recently had a baby but in labour I had to have an emergency c section due to my baby's heart rate dropping. During the c section (which I had a huge fear of, I have a phobia of surgeries and being paralysed which I had to be for the epidural) I had a huge blood loss, alarms were going off and they nearly lost me. Luckily they saved me and the baby. However I developed an infection and mastitis. My mental health was declining as labour did not go the way I planned (I wanted a water birth but was not possible) and my baby struggled to breastfeed. Drs had to put me on strong medication as the infection didn't clear up after a first course of antibiotics and I was getting worse but said I will have to stop breastfeeding. Needless to say at this point I felt like s***. I hated my body, life and myself. I wanted to breastfeed my baby for a whole year but now can't. My baby couldn't be delivered naturally. I did everything by the rule book in my pregnancy and I still feel I failed. Drs later diagnosed me with post natal depression with PTSD.

Anyway, I spoke to my husband and told him how I was feeling and that I hate my body which has been cut and bruised due to the surgery and injections I had to take. I said I'm disappointed in myself for the birth not going tge way I hoped. He turned to me and said and I quote:

""I'm disappointed in your breasts, I thought they were meant to get bigger""

My mom vaccinated and is still very careful when she goes out - masked and uses sanitizer a lot. The issue is that she watches our niece 2x a week in which she could be exposed by covid. My nieces gets watched by her grandparents 1x a week. They are vaccinated, but the BIL and 2 kids are not vaccinated. They have gotten my niece sick and even spread covid to MY MOM already.

So when the baby is here I’m extremely worried she could bring covid into our home because she watches my niece. We asked the 2-3 weeks she comes to help that she doesn’t see my niece and she’s agreed (still having to wear her mask), but how about after?

754,My wife has become more miserable than ever.,"Our daughter is almost 5 months and my wife is completely miserable. All she does is talk about how miserable she is yet she won't do anything to try and make it better. She says she doesn't have postpartum depression but she is like a black cloud everywhere she goes. She is a great mom to our daughter though. 

We had problems before she got pregnant and we're trying to work through them but honestly I don't even know if she wants to be with me. And I really don't know if I wanna be with her. I can't motivate her to try and be better or else she gets mad and acts like I'm talking down to her. She is incapable of making me feel anything other than depressed. All day at work I receive text messages about how everything sucks and how she's losing her mind. She won't get any help cause she doesn't want medicine. She has a history of mental illness and this is almost as bad as it's been. 

I feel like the biggest piece of shit cause nothing I do can make her feel good. If it weren't for our daughter we probably would have been split by now. The thought of only having my daughter part time is absolutely dreadful. She is everything for me. I love her more than words can describe.

755,When do you start a sleep schedule?,"We have a 15 week old baby. Currently, the sleep/feed schedule is reactive - he wakes up from a sleep, we do the feed/change/play routine, then put him down to sleep when he is tired. The only caveats are that we don't play in the overnight feeds, and in the feed between 630pm-930pm we also do a bedtime routine. Overall his sleep is going fairly well (for now).

At what age should we stop this, and instead set a regular schedule? That could include things like:

* Regular bedtime
* Not letting him start a nap close to bedtime
* Waking him up from a nap if it's close to bedtime
* Waking him up at a set time each morning, if he isn't already awake",beyondthebump

764,UPDATE: Going crazy trying to transition from bottle to cup,"**TL;DR - What I learned about transitioning my developmentally delayed kid from bottle to cup, with troubleshooting tips that I think could help others.**

Two months ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/no2grl/going_crazy_trying_to_transition_from_bottle_to/) about how my developmentally delayed kid (~14m birth age at the time) refused to transition to cup *at home* despite 6 months of continuous practice and us trying 8 different types of cups.  Confusingly, he was drinking out of cups with help at daycare.

I wrote up this essay of an update because:
1. I never found any resources on this issue that looked at the problem holistically.  Aside from ""keep practising and be encouraging"", everything I read was about the specific type of cup, and that turned out to only be a part of the issue.
2. As a mother of a delayed child, I was very frustrated by the lack of shared experience I could find on Reddit.  Of course every child is different, but I think I learned some troubleshooting approaches that may help other parents in similar situations.

**Current situation**
My kid is now 16m2w and likely borderline normal/delayed (next assessment in 2 months). We have now been 1 whole week bottle-free without drama.  He doesn't drink as much milk using cups at home as he did using bottles, but his total dairy intake is OK.  I packed away all the bottle stuff this morning because I'm pretty confident that we're finally past that stage.

**What I learned**
Looking back at this 8-month journey, I think there were 4 key factors at play:
* Skills
    * There is a sequence of 3 tasks my kid needed to master: sucking/sipping effectively, bringing liquid from the front of his mouth to the back of his mouth, and swallowing.  Bottle-drinking doesn't have that middle step, and the first step is simpler because it's easier to form a seal with the nipple.
    * I think the predominant advice on transitioning to cups focuses on products because that's the only task we can influence.  However, all 3 tasks need to be done in sequence over and over again.
    * My kid took ~5 months to master these tasks with a hard sippy spout, and 6-7 months for soft sippy spout and straw cup.  We will work on open cups next.
    * Tip: if your kid has been struggling for a long time with the transition, check these 3 tasks.  Is the problem getting liquid in the mouth?  If so, a different type of cup might help.  If the problem is with the next two steps, it might be better to stick with one cup and be mentally prepared for a long wait.  Keep praticing though.
* Temperament
    * At the time of my post, my kid already had the skills.  The problem was his temperament.  My kid is very stubborn and habit-driven.  I think he derived a lot of comfort from the bottle, so was *actually* really offended by the cup at home.  Cups are for daycare.  How dare mama offer a cup at home?!?
    * I mentioned in my last post that we went cold turkey.  That time, he went for 36 hours drinking only 0.5 oz.  I had to stop because he was quite dehydrated.  When I talked to his pediatrician later, she said that cold turkey is the only way, and that she's OK with a little dehydration.  A week ago, we went cold turkey again.  I think he's a lot more ready this time, so the thirst won out and he begrudgingly switched.
    * Tip: if you have a stubborn kid, decide where the line is for you.  Are you OK with them being really upset?  Not drinking?  Not eating?  For how long?
* Incentive
    * My kid is difficult to incentivize.  He doesn't like sweet beverages.  He doesn't get FOMO.  He doesn't want to imitate us.  He just wants something his way or nothing at all.  When he was still mastering the 3 tasks, he just wanted to taste the milk.  That only required him to get the milk in his mouth, so he wasn't incentivized to practice the next two steps.
    * I wish I knew what incentivizes him in general.  For this transition, I think it was toast.  He loves toast and wants to eat all the toast, but it makes him thirsty.  So I suspect he drank the milk/water cup offered to him so he could eat more toast.
    * Tip: figure out your child's unique incentive.  It might also be social reward, like clapping and cheering.  It might be attention.  It might be something seemingly unrelated.
* Product design
    * I tried 8 products in total.  For me, the Munchkin Miracle 360 cup was a cool design that did nothing to help my kid master the 3 tasks.  I understand that it works great for some kids though, maybe due to temperament or incentive.
    * For sippy cups and straw cups, the biggest design barrier for my kid has been the anti-leak valves.  For the Munchkin click lock weighted straw cup, the straw is very thin and the valve makes the flow extreeemely slow.  The rest of the cup's design is fantastic, so I used a chopstick and a knife to open up the valve.  This modified cup is the first straw cup my kid mastered, and is currently in heavy rotation.
    * Tip: because of the interplay between skills, temperament and incentive, product design issues can be non-existent or highly specific to your kid.  The only thing I can say is to try the product yourself to see what their experience might be.  It's all trial and error basically.

765,Maternal rage,"I feel like 18 months into being a mom in the midst of a pandemic and having to cope with chronic illness is literally pushing me to the edge. I live abroad with no friends and family in the vicinity. And with the pandemic it’s not like my family can come visit and lend a hand, so everything becomes so much tougher. 

I had postpartum depression which had been treated and it has gotten a lot better but now I feel it has gotten a lot worse all of a sudden as I’m going to move to a different country and city. And the move has proven itself to be rather stressful due to the lack of planning from my partner. He is a procrastinator whereas I’m not. And now we are suffering as a result of his procrastination. 

On top of that my kid hasn’t been so easy. He doesn’t sleep well as per usual. Naps are difficult but his tantrums has escalated. 

I feel my depression creeping back and along with it, a lot of anger. I also feel like I’m just auto piloting everyday. I don’t step out of the house. I don’t want to talk to my friends because I’m not interested in gossip or the latest trends. I’m just perpetually tired. I felt that I’ve hit a new low recently.

766,LO in extreme discomfort sometimes when eating,"Hey! Looking for advice or to see if anyone's experienced this with their LO. We are combo feeding our 7 week LO. We switched to Enfamil Sensitive formula ( lower lactose) at about 4 weeks because she was in a lot of gas pain then and it seemed to help. 

For a period of the day when we're feeding our LO now she'll appear to be in pain and yelling with the bottle in her mouth. She also doesn't want you to take the bottle away, but is super distressed. It's hard to watch. It's not all the time- maybe primarily in the afternoon? And we don't think it's happening with breast milk.

We've wondered if we should try soy formula. My wife is not lactose free, though, and it doesn't make sense that our LO would have a lactose sensitivity and be ok with breastmilk. Our LO  does get more formula than breast milk, though.

773,Toddler Injured Under Grandmother's Care,"Hello, 

My wife and I are not sure how to handle this situation so I figured you guys might have some insight. 

We were staying at the in-laws for a few days before we headed back home from our baby-cation (wife is about 7 moths along). While we were sorting out some issues with our travel in the kitchen, Grandma watched our toddler and the 5 year old cousin. We hear a thump and look over to see our child on the ground crying and the Grandmother moving fast to chastise the cousin. After more than 45 minutes of extreme crying we decided we needed to head to the hospital. After 6 hours in the emergency room it turns out that our child has a broken collar bone. 

\*\*\*Some back story on the cousin, his mother was a drug addict and neglected him as a baby. His Father got full custody but for the past 4 years has let the Grandmother care for him everyday regardless of the Father's work schedule. Often he will wait to pick him up so that he is tired by the time they get home and will go straight to bed. The cousin has been evaluated by therapists and doctors but the Grandmother ignores their recommendations, preferring to keep him isolated from anything or anyone that may see his actions and behaviors.\*\*\*

The next day we try to get an idea as to what happened, and the Grandmother claims to have seen nothing and defends the cousin through and through saying he would never intentionally hurt our child. Seems fishy so we speak with the cousins father, the Grandfather and my wife's two other brothers to see if they have heard anything different. Every single one of them has a different story from the Grandmother. After a while the Grandmother changes the story to try and place blame on our child, claiming she must have been climbing on her cousin and fell or that she was somehow responsible for the injury. 

We get home and ask our child what happened (took a bit since she is three) but in the end her story was that her cousin was on the ground, she asked if he was ok and his response was to get up and slam her to the ground. 

We're not sure what to do in this situation, do we keep the Grandmother out of her life until she decides to tell us the truth? Do we wait and see if they ever try to correct the cousins behavior issues? Should we keep our distance until they decide to get the cousin the help he needs? We're at a loss, we don't want to separate family bonds but protecting our child is a top priority.

This gave us time to unwind at night and prepare for the morning. 

But since she turned eight months she’s been going up several times between her 8pm and 12am sleep shift, and usually by 2am we bring her to our her where she sleeps until 5am, 6am if we’re lucky. When this happens one of us sleeps on the couch with our dog (don’t judge us) and it’s kinda hard to get ready for the work day. Waking up at 5am and showering is harder to do when the baby is asleep. I start work back up soon and I guess I’m just looking for similar experience so I know I’m not alone! 

Oh also, she’s definitely teething, little suckers are popping out left and right. Not in a painful way but last night at 2am she refused her bottle and kept licking her gums/teeth in her sleep. Could this also be why she sleeps better with one of us in our bed versus alone?",beyondthebump

Is there a brand that has a size that would be in-between and fit him? Any recommendations are appreciated",beyondthebump

793,Is assigning gender at the 18wk anatomy scan appropriate? Should we assign gender at all?,"Hello lovelies!

&gt;**Disclaimer**: I know this topic is something that people have really strong opinions about but please, please, please be respectful of and kind to each other (and kind to me), I'm really interested in your point of view and I'd love for this to be a safe place for you to share it without worrying that you'll be attacked. &lt;3

I'm not a mother (yet), I'm a medical student who just completed her obstetrics and gynaecology rotation and I noticed both in the antenatal clinics and in the birth suite with the midwives, that there was a huge focus on gender assignment, and it was all very binary (Male or Female, nothing else) and anatomical. It seemed like every 18 week scan consultation started with ""are we finding out the gender, or letting it be a surprise?"", or in the birth suites ""so what are you having?"" or ""do you know the gender?"" was often the *very next* question asked after making introductions.

Medically this is a really outdated understanding of gender identity but what surprised me is how deeply entrenched it was in the culture of obstetrics, gynaecology and midwifery, and I feel like, as medical practitioners we should be acting based on the most up to date medical information that we have, taking into account both Mum's and bub's wellbeing.

So I was wondering:

1. Should medical professionals remove this kind of vocabulary from our practice in obstetrics, gynaecology and midwifery?
2. Should 18wk anatomy scans just report the actual anatomy (penis, vagina or ambiguous genitalia), and not attach a gender to them?
3. What are your opinions about raising children in environments that best enable self-discovery with regard to gender identity?

Let me know! xx",beyondthebump
794,What should I do??,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years now with some breaks in between.

I have to beg him or get in a fight with him over the game for him to pay attention to either of us, and when he does spend time with his son he’s still playing games on his phone with headphones in and doesn’t play with his baby!

798,AITA? Mother/Baby/Partner sleep edition.,"Okay, I’m going to attempt to be as unbiased as possible, which is going to be hard because I just came into the bedroom to put the baby to sleep in a huff after having yet another fight with my partner about this topic.

So, my partner and I have a recurring argument about mother/baby/partner sleep. A little background... My baby is nine months old, and is a pretty awesome sleeper, which I credit mostly to co-sleeping(please spare me any arguments against it, nothing’s gonna change). My partner and I are both servers, but I have been unemployed and collecting unemployment since last March due to covid and us living in a town where work is seasonal. I have been a stay-at-home mom since October when he was born. My partner has been in and out of his work due to shut downs, and is now on seasonal break from work since June 27th, and will return October 1st.

I am a girl who loooves her sleep. Like, 10 hours a night is my sweet spot. Obviously, since having a baby, that has changed a bit. Baby’s bedtime is 9ish, but he usually isn’t passed out until about 9:30-10. He usually wakes 1-2 times with me going in to nurse him for a few minutes before I end up going to bed anywhere from 12:00-12:30, and my baby wakes up for the day around 7:45-8:30.

So, I have asked my partner if he wouldn’t mind letting me sleep in occasionally, since I wake with the baby every morning and never get the opportunity to. My partner is a self-proclaimed “night owl”, due to him getting off work late and not being able to wind down for a few hours(his words), and goes to bed anywhere from 2:30-4:30. So by the time I am up with the baby, it’s common he’s only slept 3-4 hours. 

Jump to now, he’s been out of work for almost a month and a half, and I am still being met with resistance about having a day to sleep in. The argument has gone back and forth from him saying things like “okay, just give me some time to adjust my schedule”, to “let’s just have the baby go to sleep later, like ten, so that we all get more sleep”, to “you get 7-8 hours every night while I only get 3-4”. 

I have told him that I don’t want to move the baby’s sleep to a later time because I am already so tired by 9 from taking care of him all day, and that the couple hours at the end of the night are the only time I get to spend with him, and with myself. He says that if he sleeps later, he’ll wake later and we’ll all get more sleep, and that I’m being unmoving and unwilling to budge. I say that he thinks his sleep is more valuable than mine, and he says the same to me. I feel that I have given him enough time to adjust his schedule, and that it is his choice to continue to go to bed so late.

I am at a loss... Am I missing something? Is there room to work this?

799,Baby laundry FAIL after FAIL! LOL,"I keep ruining my babys precious clothes in the wash!! I HATE laundry, ok? But I make an effort to take out stains and wash colors separately (in an effort to pass on the clothes), but to no avail, most of my 9-month old's clothes are ruined either from stains I couldnt fix (we do BLW!) or from darkened clothes (I washed colors and darks together). Dang it, I feel I can never get it right, even when I try!

800,Time to yourself,"Hi everyone! I can’t stop feeling tremendously guilty anytime I want a night to myself while DH spends time with LO.

 DH goes out about two nights a week to spend with friends; and I think it’s great! I can’t bring myself to do the same though, and it’s starting to really get me down. DH has done camping, been to all day 9+ hour gaming tournaments etc. the most time I’ve had to myself since LO was born is 4 hours at a time to get out for an afternoon. I’m grateful… but I’m sometimes going to need more. 

We have no help from my side, and his family does not listen to safe sleep practices and such so I don’t really feel comfortable with them babysitting. DH works and I’m a SAHM, and I feel like a bad mother if I do my own thing. This isn’t sustainable!

Every night is the same. Eat dinner. Dishes. LO Bedtime routine. Pump. Sleep (if baby sleeps).

It’s getting SO OLD!! It’s been this way now for almost a year. Not a single dinner out. Not a single movie even just on Netflix. Not a single glass of wine. Nothing. 

So what do you guys do for time to yourself? What do you like to do and how much time do you see as reasonable? I was even thinking a weekend to myself to have some extended “me” time. Of course DH would get a weekend too. 

I just need ideas for what to do and how much to do. I need something to my life more than just being a mom even though I love LO DEARLY.",beyondthebump

804,VBAC for C-section due to failure to progress?,"I had a baby mid June. After 3 hours of pushing it was deemed that he was struck at the pelvic bone and not coming out so I had an emergency C-section. My regular doctor finally spoke to the doctor that delivered my baby to inquire why the baby got stuck…and basically he doesn’t remember. He thinks the baby was sunny side up but is not sure. However since my baby wasn’t particularly big my doctor says there’s a chance another baby wouldn’t fit through.

My question - I was wondering…are there were any mamas out there who had to have a c-section due to “failure to progress” but was able to have a successful VBAC later?

I really want to try to have vaginal birth for the next baby. However I’m scared of going through hours of labor just to have another emergency c-section

805,I wish my partner was more supportive.,"My little babe was born on July 21st, so just over two weeks old. Breast feeding has been a difficult journey, which no one really talks about. I’m currently struggling with supply, both through BF and pumping. We are constantly topping baby up with formula, because he cries and cries and shows hunger cues after every feed. 

Tonight I broke down. Baby was crying, I was crying. We were fighting with each other to find the right amount of formula that would satisfy his needs. I pumped to see how much I’d get…50mls total. I also have hypothyroidism, which has an impact on breast milk production, especially after it takes a while to level out those hormones after childbirth. I’m taking supplements, I’m hydrating, I’m eating well. Im doing everything I can in my control. 

Let me start by saying my partner is an amazing dad and has been generally supportive during the initial postpartum days. But today, I confessed that I’m considering ending my breast feeding journey. My husband became short with me, and not very understanding. He said “well then just pump so you know how much he gets”. I explained that I don’t want to be hooked up to a machine all day, where he became dismissive and literally said “k”. Then turns to the baby and says “I don’t think you want to be a formula only baby”. 

I already feel extremely guilty for wanting to end my BF journey. I just wish he could see my point of view and show some support. I’m at the point where I wish my supply would dry up all together on its own, so it was no longer a choice. 

Anyone else struggle with this?",beyondthebump

807,Please talk me off this guilt ledge about pictures,"So my baby was born just as the second wave of COVID started so visitors were not really an option. He had a rough start and spent his first day and a half in the NNICU where my husband and I were not allowed to visit him together. We had about 12 hours all together in the hospital, but I spent most of that getting my blood sugars managed (Type 1 diabetic) and trying to figure out how to breastfeed.

All of this cumulates to me never doing/getting a professional newborn shoot for my son. At first I told myself it was for the best to wait (COVID, he was very bruised from birth trauma, I was so swollen and could hardly move), but now he’s like 9 months old and I never did it. I just saw my friends beautiful newborn shoot with their 2 day old baby and I am drowning in mom guilt. 

I have zero high quality pictures of my little baby. Now I have this spunky little man with teeth who refuses to sit still and sometimes I miss my baby, but I have so little to look back at. I don’t know why, but it’s just hitting me super hard tonight. I feel like I messed up big time and there is no going back.

2. My daughter has an ongoing cough from day care, the cold ended a few weeks ago. I messaged my sister before saying this and does she still want me to come. She told me her son has never been sick and she wants me to still come. He ended up catching the sickness and now he has a cough. I feel terrible he got it but I did tell her before and I didn’t know she would be contagious. She has texted me I’m a bad mother because i work and send my baby to day care where she gets sick, and how terrible it is. 

3. She cosntalty tells me I don’t feed her solids properly, she offered her a big chunk of steak while we were at a dinner and I said “no way she can’t have that”. Since then she says how weird it is she doesn’t have real food. But she does have solids! Just not big chunks",beyondthebump
810,No more.,"I have one LO. He’s two and a half now. I have no intentions of having any more kids. Between the preeclampsia, his poor health when he was first born, and the crippling PPD that never fully went away I don’t think I could handle another baby.

Everyone always tells me one day I’ll want another. Or that I need to give my son a sibling. And it drives me crazy.

Because it’s not that I don’t want a baby. I love my son and I love babies, but I know in my heart that having another child would make me a worse mother. There are days I struggle with one already as it is. How could I throw another one on top? And risk myself at the same time? The preeclampsia almost killed me. And my son was so small as a result. He couldn’t eat or stay awake and ended up in the ER at four days old because of it.

814,"I feel so weak and it's frustrating me because I thought my second postpartum experience would be like my first, but I'm struggling and everything feels like jello.","My first baby, I was only 22 and pushed her out in fifteen minutes with no tearing after an induction for suspected cholestasis. I had an epidural, no issues from that... She was nearly 8lbs. I immediately ""lost"" all the baby weight once the swelling was gone due to hyperemesis, and felt normal. My doctor actually praised my weight loss which pissed me off. 

The second time around, I still had hyperemesis but my doctor took me seriously this time and gave me Zofran at 8 weeks, because otherwise I would be in the hospital constantly due to dehydration. I began to eat anything I craved just because it was easier than dealing with the nausea, at least I held it down... Not only that but my sciatic nerve began to give out by the third trimester and make it impossible to walk, I often was low energy and often just layed around because moving was so painful. 

I am now 26, had my baby on July 31st and it wasn't an induction this time. I got an epidural again. Baby was 8 lbs, 10 ounces and I went from being 4 cm dilated at 6 am to fully dilated by noon, pushed him out in 15 minutes and felt relieved I had another ""easy"" labour. However my back is numb from the middle to my lower back, my sciatic pain is still there, I can hardly lift my legs, rolling over still is just as uncomfortable as when I was pregnant. I am scared to strain anything down there because I am scared I might prolapse or something, and it just all feels like jello. I can't walk for more than a few minutes without getting dizzy.

I literally do every single thing, most of the time he sits on the sofa watching me do it. How can you just sit there watching someone breaking their back? 

I am so burnet out by the end of the day, if he at least helped with the baby but he hardly does anything when it comes to caring for LO. He will never feed him or do bath time, never cooked for him. Hi still hasn't been left alone with him for more than 2 hours. When I ask him to take LO for a walk he comes back in like 15 minutes I am not even joking, so I stopped asking. I think he took LO out for a walk by himself maybe 10 times and LO is now 9 months old. Doesn't do any night time feeds etc. He thinks he is a good dad because he is a ""fun dad"" and this type of thinking makes me wanna cringe.

826,Seeking other exclusive pumpers,"Hi there! I am seeking out other moms who exclusively pump to get some feedback or tips about how to increase my supply. 
I work 40+hours/week and my only time to work on boosting my supply is over the weekend. I can make at BEST 6oz first thing in the morning after pumping for 45 minutes. I only have two breaks to pump and I get 1.5 - 2oz total after 25 minutes. I am barely making enough for my daughter and now that she's almost 5 months, she is going to need more than 3 or 4oz per bottle. I can only make enough for four bottles which I send with her to our care givers house. She is formula fed otherwise. 

This is my plan so far for this weekend as I have nothing going on: 
-pump every two hours ~25 minutes (my flow is very slow but I know that shorter sessions more frequently helps) 
- two power-pump sessions each day (sat and sun) 

And these are my plans for everyday going forward:
-up my supplement dosages (this includes lactation snacks, capsules, and herbal drops)
-drink at least one extra 32oz bottle of water on top of my 3 bottles daily. 

For those who may have questions: my daughter started to refuse the breast at 2 months and wasn't gaining weight, she preferred bottles. I wasn't making enough milk, I woke up one day and she nursed as usual but would get very angry and acted like she was starving. I started pumping to help boost my supply for her and found I was only making maybe 2 oz between the two breasts at best. It took me almost two weeks of round the clock nursing and pumping to get my supply to where it is now. I refuse to give up making milk for my daughter.",beyondthebump
827,Pregnancy changed my mole/ possible melanoma?,"Hello! I am a 21 year old female and I’ve had this mole on my stomach since I was a toddler. My mom had it looked at and the dr said it was fine. For as long as I can remember, it’s looked the same, and honestly has always been funny looking (bigger than a pencil eraser, asymmetrical, 2 colors) in high school/middle school we would get the classic speech about skin cancer Warning signs. I would always go home in sheer panic and my mom would reassure me that I’ve always had it, and I was fine. I’d like to add, I’m not blaming my mom, because I know that if she thought something was wrong, she would not brush me off. Anyways, her reassurance would calm me down and I would forget about it. I had my son 7 weeks ago. During my pregnancy I ballooned up, and my stomach became stretch mark city, which made my mole stretch. During my PP appointment my dr made a comment about my mole looking funny. I came home in a sheer panic, actually did research and now I’m worried sick. I called the dermatologist today, and in order to be seen I have to be referred by my primary care dr. The earliest they can get me in is Monday.

828,3 month old crying in sleep,"Hi all! My LO is exactly 3 months old. For the last week, he's been sleeping 8 hours throughout the night without waking up for a feed - yay! Since this started, he's occasionally cried while asleep with his eyes closed. I have his bassinet right next to my bed, so I'll pat him a bit, and the crying stops. However, last night he intermittently cried from 2am to 6am. Again, patting him or giving him a pacifier soothed him. He never woke up during his crying spells, so I didn't pick him up to try to comfort him. Am I doing the right thing? And is this crying during his sleep something they'll eventually grow out of?

830,Anyone else nervous or cautious about having a big 1 year old birthday (or any birthday) because of the pandemic? How did you celebrate 1 year old?,"Hi,

I am new mom to a 9 month old. I wanted to have am outdoor party for my baby and invite people who have not seen her yet, but I'm nervous about the delta variant. My baby shower was outdoors in Sept 2020 and I only invited 10 people and we all wore masks and stayed 6 feet apart. I felt safe. 

As I start to add names to the list, I'm feeling more and more nervous and almost want to cancel it and have a small thing with just my parents. I just don't want anyone to pass anything to anyone, especially since little kids can't be vaccinated. And I don't want anyone to feel jealous they weren't invited, like if I voted my sibling but not my partner's sibling and families.

How have you guys chosen to deal with this?

(Also, I'm a covid long hauler from catching covid from my partner 3 weeks postpartum, so I am very intimidated by this illness. I just now started to feel 50% better.)

843,Advice on flying with a 4-month-old,"Wake windows are 1.45/2/2/2, 4 feeds a day, and she STTN 7:30-7:30 with no wakeups. Flight is at 7am, planning on leaving home around 5am to get to the airport at 5:30. I’ll be wearing her through security (fully covered by the Bjorn weather cover) and she’ll be in her stroller the rest of the time with a cover on. I have no idea how to manage her WW and feeds on this day to keep her on as close to a regular schedule as possible, so I’m hoping for some help!

- Do I proactively feed her upon waking (4:30 am-ish)? Or do I wait and see if she cries for food (possibly at the airport or in the car)? She won’t have been fed since the prior night, so while she’s capable of going until 7:30 am without food, I’m also not going to starve her if she’s awake and hungry. 

- If I feed her earlier than she normally eats first thing in the morning, how do I adjust feeds for the rest of the day? She reliably eats 7-8 oz at 4-hour intervals and is not a snacker. If I try and fit a small feed aka “snack” somewhere in there to account for the fact that it will be an extra long day for her, I’m concerned that it’ll throw off her appetite for the rest of the day. 

- Feed through takeoff/landing—I’ve heard to do this to relieve the pressure in their ears, but is a paci equally effective? Like I said, baby is not a snacker so she likely won’t feed at takeoff and landing both, given that it’s a relatively short flight. Also, I may have fed her not too long before takeoff depending on whether she wants to eat when she wakes.

-Do I try and stick to our usual WW given that she does not sleep on the go, or attempt to make up for lost sleep with extra long naps once we reach our destination? I don’t want to throw her nights off with too much afternoon/early evening sleep. If we lose the 12-hour nights thanks to something we did (aka, traveled with her), I’ll hate myself
forever. 😅 

Some background: we’re using a car service that provides a car seat, holding her for the flight, and there will be a car seat at our destination. So I can’t load her from her bassinet directly into her car seat, belt it in/out of the Uber, and attach it to the stroller base at the airport, and hope she sleeps in there for most of the trip.",beyondthebump
844,How to best help Dad bond with newborn?,"Hey everyone! 

Our LO is just over two weeks, and we are totally enamoured with her - she’s pretty chill overall (or, as chill as a two week old baby gets, you know?).

Right now I am breastfeeding, and we are also giving her a bottle of expressed milk 1-2 times a day.

846,Severely anxious about baby’s sleep/nighttime/waking up,"So I’ve had this anxiety since she was born pretty much, but I feel like it’s getting even worse ironically even though her nighttime sleep has gotten better. She’s 15 weeks now and has recently been on more of an actual schedule, before the last week or so she literally just went to bed whenever and really late, like anywhere 9:00pm-12:00am. That did stress me out because I had no idea when she’d sleep, and it was disappointing if husband and I got a drink and some snacks and planned to watch a movie (or even one episode of something) but then she stayed up until late so we didn’t have time. But I figured she’ll eventually sleep. 

However now that she actually has a schedule and sticks to it pretty well I feel MORE anxious. She’s been going to Sleep between 7:00-8:00pm the last week and usually waking once at around 12:00-2:00am and again at 5:00-6:00am and sometimes she stays awake for an hour or so then, but sometimes she’ll sleep again until 7:30-8:15 or so. But I’m SOOOOO anxious all evening before I go to bed. I can’t even enjoy my newfound free evening time because I’m constantly anxious she’ll wake up and it’ll ruin her schedule for days and she’ll never go back to sleep and… just yeah all of that. I literally feel sick to my stomach I’m so nervous about it. Every sound she makes, every time she stirs in her sleep I just grit my teeth and hold my breath. Every ambulance that goes by outside or slightly loud sound me or my husband makes I just grit my teeth and freeze and my stomach drops hoping she won’t wake up. I can’t even live I’m tiptoeing around I’m popping my head in the room to stare at her every 10 minutes. I even hear phantom crying or other sounds. I used to view showers as a relaxing break but now every single shower I hear phantom crying and think she woke up so I just shower as quickly as I can and don’t even enjoy it. 

She actually did wake up again about 2 hours after she went down to bed tonight because some asshole gang of motorbikes drove by outside with the loudest engines I’ve heard in my life. It is a pretty noisy street so I’m used to bikes and sirens and she usually won’t even wake up, but these bikes were UNGODLY loud. Sounded like they were 1cm away from me. 

Our apartment is tiny so I don’t know if that exacerbates the issue. It’s literally two rooms total (NOT two bedroom) so I either have to be in the room with her even after she goes to bed, or in the other room which has no air conditioning so we still have to keep the door between rooms opened to not die of heat stroke so we still have to be super quiet. I want to move so badly to a bigger place but long story short there’s something we have to finish doing first that’s still not done and I don’t know when it will be done so I don’t know when we can move. 


Also during the night when she wakes up she usually nurses and goes back to sleep quickly and easily but I still get such stomach churning anxiety about if she will wake up and refuse to sleep again or something. I end up staying awake longer just to stare at her to make sure she’s really asleep. Sometimes right when I put my head down on the pillow she makes a sound or I hear her moving and I get nauseous thinking she’s waking up again. My whole day is just occupied planning her naps and then bedtime and then obsessed with keeping her asleep I feel like. It’s mentally exhausting. 

My husband does help put her to sleep by carrying her around and rocking her, but recently I even feel stressful if he does that. I feel like me nursing her to sleep is faster and more effective so I get nervous watching him try and just want to grab her and do it myself.

I’m also so paranoid about the 4 month sleep regression because she’s coming up to 4 months and I feel like any day now could be the last night of decent sleep we get. I DON’T want to sleep train so I’m not even sure how you can handle the regression without sleep training. I’m fine with nursing or rocking her back to sleep but what happens with the regression if you do that? They just eventually go back to sleeping longer anyway??

I’ve been having some burning pain just on the right side of my incision, above it and below it. I wouldn’t say it’s severe but it definitely makes walking harder…I had been moving around great after a week and then this pain comes and hits me hard. My incision looks and feels fine; no discharge, no smell, no redness, the incision doesn’t feel hot. It’s just this burning pain around it on the right side. Anyone have a similar experience?

Is it possible that I was overdoing it with stairs etc? I felt fine to go up the stairs after 5-6 days so my husband, baby and I transitioned to sleeping upstairs in our room. I had even started getting up and out of bed to feed and change her during the night. Getting up was a struggle but once i was out of bed, I’d feel fine to pick her up and take care of her. But now I’m back on the couch with my husband taking care of her during nights so I don’t overdo it (we’re formula feeding so this has been easy for us to do, but the mom guilt is still real when she cries because it’s so hard for me to get up and help). 

Also, maybe I’m not being diligent enough with my pain meds? I still have oxycodone that I save for night time so I can try and sleep or when we’re taking her to appts, and then alternating between extra strength Tylenol and 600 mg ibuprofen. To be honest, I’m not great with keeping up with the OTC meds. I wonder if that’s why my pain feels so bad?

861,I'm feeling it.,"Baby is eight months, and there have been so many exciting milestones. But with her awareness and development comes a lot of need for attention and energy I don't have. And it's proving difficult to keep up with all her needs. So is obsessed with practicing walking. Which is great and wonderful, to be sure. But when she's not holding on to my hands walking, she wants to be all over me, and by me, and picked up. My back has been killing me and I have to do extra exercises. 
     
It's also been difficult during this time to find childcare. And even when I had childcare lined up, the most unfortunate events occurred. For instance, the nanny was sick, so we canceled care for a time. Later, my partner, my baby and I all fell ill. We canceled care again and I struggled to watch my baby, who recovered faster than I did. I also had to work at some point, and could luckily do so at home. But watching her, working, and recovering was a nightmare. Especially with all her growth support wants and needs.

862,My baby is “selfish” for crying,"I was chatting with my mom on FaceTime today and tried to make a light-hearted comment about how my nearly 10 month old is developing quite the personality. I brought it up because these days she’s really discovering what she wants—for example, to both climb on me AND be freely wandering the floor at the same time. To touch everything that isn’t baby safe. To have every single thing I’m holding and then switch her interest the second I switch what’s in my hands. 

When I made the comment though about her personality really starting to show (and maybe something about how the toddler years are bound to be wild), my mom said something along the lines of “of course babies are like that, they’re selfish.” She *often* has a reply like this, talking about baby’s selfishness/ability to manipulate/“sin nature” (she’s Christian, as is my whole family—I am agnostic and avoiding talking about religion with them). 

To me, my baby is learning, growing, exploring boundaries. Of course she’s going to cry—she doesn’t understand why I took away the hairband or covered the electrical outlet. She’s learning what’s ok and what’s not, she’s using her amazing little scientific brain to try out new things all the time. She makes me crazy but watching her learn is beautiful. It’s my mom that really drives me crazy though. I don’t feel like my baby crying over me taking away an object makes her selfish or sinful—it makes her a baby. 

Just wanted to rant. Honestly, conversations like that with my mom make me not want to share things with her!",beyondthebump

866,"My one week old daughter, the stubborn side sleeper","Officially one week postpartum today, and I’m suffering terribly. I’m not sure if it’s baby blues or PPD/PPA already, but I’ve been raising my daughter completely alone ever since. (Husband is away for training with military, family is across country/covid makes traveling difficult, hiring help is very expensive) 

Now…. My entire life is revolving constantly around this little stranger. All I can do is feed, burp, change, and hold her. One-handed foods are my only friend. I don’t sleep more than an hour. She CONSTANTLY wants to be held, so she doesn’t sleep on her own much. But when I finally do get her to lay down in her own crib or bassinet… she rolls to her side. Every single time. I’ve tried swaddling tighter, I’ve stopped swaddling completely now, I don’t know how to keep her on her back. I’ve made the area as safe as possible, no extra blankets or toys or anything other than the tightest sheet I could find.

875,Struggling with coping,"This post will probably be super super long. Apologies in advance, I think I just need to get it all out. 

I was induced a few weeks ago at 39w exactly for gestational hypertension. My body was NOT ready for baby whatsoever. I wasn't even 1 cm dilated and barely effaced. So, right when I got to the hospital they started me on medication to ripen my cervix. It was just a teeny pill that was inserted into my vagina. After 18 hours and multiple doses, my contractions were too close together to get another dose and they put in a foley bulb to keep things moving along. After a few hours, the pain from the bulb was EXCRUCIATING. I opted for some morphine and after a few more hours, I was finally dilated enough to start on pitocin. Everything was going smoothly and I was comfortable until about 10 hours in. I finally gave in and got the epidural. Turns out I was 7cm dilated by then and they manually broke my water. After that, things took a horrible turn. I was in horrible horrible pain for hours. I felt like the epidural was doing absolutely nothing. I was just lying there crying for hours. Turns out baby's head was blocking a part of the catheter they put in. My bladder was full but the urine couldn't get out. I never knew a full bladder can cause so much pain. Finally, after an entire afternoon of feeling like my bladder was going to explode it was time to push. I pushed for over 3 hours and my nurse checked my vitals. I spiked a fever and she called the midwives in. They suspected an infection and were doing all they could to move things along and get baby out. I pushed a little longer and they finally decided to call an OB in to see if I could have an assisted vaginal delivery since I was making no progress. More pushing. More screaming and crying. Baby boy was ""OP"" or ""sunny side up."" His head was down but he was facing towards my abdomen rather than towards my back. The OB told me that I was doing everything I could, pushing perfectly -- BUT, what was happening was every time I pushed he would come down and once the contraction ended he would get sucked back up. Absolutely no progress for over 3 hours. This made it impossible to try for the assisted vaginal birth methods. At this point, they were concerned about my fever and infection AND baby became tachycardic. They suggested a c-section to get baby out as soon as possible. After 48 hours of labor, they adjusted my epidural (no idea what they did, but I was way more comfortable), re-did my catheter, and brought me into the OR. A few minutes later and I was holding my sweet, perfect baby boy. 

Holding him made the past few days feel so worth it. My heart never felt so full. The recovery days in postpartum were really overwhelming though. Babe was having the hardest time latching (thanks flat nipples). We tried nipple shields but they were incredibly painful and I was bleeding every time I tried to nurse. I had multiple meetings with lactation counselors, which was helpful. However, the other nurses were constantly pressuring me to nurse and pump, nurse and pump. A few were awful, treating me as if I wasn't trying hard enough. It was honestly the most exhausting 4 days of my life. I wanted to go home. 

Once we got home, things felt so much better. I decided to just combo feed and pump rather than feed from the breast. It was working out relatively well. Babe was adjusting very well to being home and DH was an angel. But... I still couldn't help but feel so sad. I have these moments of intense sadness thinking about my birth experience and just how different life feels now. I love baby boy, but I just felt so empty sometimes.

A week postpartum, I woke up at 2AM shaking/shivering/teeth chattering uncontrollably. Freaked out, my husband rushed me to the ER. They admitted me for an infection but had no idea where it was. The suspected my uterus since that's where it was when I gave birth, but I had no discomfort or pain there. They then suspected mastitis, as my left breast was red, hot, sore, and incredibly hard (couldn't get any milk out). So here I was again, back in the hospital. I was so overwhelmed with emotions. I couldn't stop crying for hours. Being away from baby in the ER while waiting for a room, laying there thinking about how much pain I was in last time I was there... my anxiety was through the roof. I stayed for three days on some pretty powerful antibiotics. 

I'm finally home and feeling mostly good, but I woke up this morning with a gnarly rash/hives all over my entire body. My midwife suspects it's a delayed reaction to all of the antibiotics or due to the hormonal imbalances post-delivery. It's not painful or super itchy, but it's just everywhere. Trying to be grateful that it doesn't seem to be something to be worried about, but I'm just so overwhelmed. I feel like so many things have already gone awry and I can't help but feel so beat up.

It might be a combination of the birth trauma, hormones, and good ol' baby blues but I'm terrified that I have PPD. All I want is hugs, but every time DH holds me I cry and cry and cry and can't even verbalize why I'm crying. DH has been wonderful and has encouraged me to seek additional help and has looked at resources with me. I think I'll join a local support group, but I just needed to get all of this off my chest.",beyondthebump

879,"7 months old, always wants to be held","So I'm googling and getting tons of conflicting messages. 

Anwer 1: Don't spoil them. Constantly responding to crying makes babies expect to always get their needs met and will set them up to be spoiled and demanding. Ok, that's plausible. 

Answer 2: Don't listen to them, you can't spoil a baby. They're going to be demanding in the first year because they can't do for themselves. Letting them know they can get everything they need from mom and dad makes them feel more comfortable being adventurous. Not meeting their needs will either make them insecure or just give up on expectations. 

What's the right answer? He will sometimes be happy playing with his toys and sitting along but we've got maybe a 15 minute window and then screaming. It's clearly not a physical need. Clean diaper, well-fed and he immediately stops when new stimulus is provided. He's pretty happy remaining attached to mom like a limpet or he's happy with me if I'm up and moving. He's fascinated by any new thing he sees. But if I sit with him he gets very upset. I can be up and trying to cook in the kitchen and he's happy but I can't do much with one hand. He can sometimes be happy with a baby chair on the counter (back from the edge and anything he can grab) since he can see what I'm doing. But when he's over it he must be held or the screaming starts again. 

My wife is in the you can't spoil a baby camp. I'm in the ""I just want to get some peace and quiet without harming my baby"" camp. I'm worried about the cry it out approach because yeah, you might get him to stop crying but so does a plastic bag. 

Every parent thinks their baby is special, of course, and this is my first child and I haven't had much experience with others. My wife helped raise a dozen nephews and nieces and says he's different from all of them. Super interested in what the adults are doing, little interest in toys, always paying attention. He won't let himself sleep much during the day because there's always something more interesting to be paying attention to. He doesn't want the bottle anymore because we don't drink from the bottle so he wants his milk from an open top glass. He demands everyone shares equally so we have to take turns miming use of the binky, he wants to taste what we're eating and we have to take tastes of his food to show we're sharing (or he wants us to prove it's not poison.) Our pediatrician keeps checking the charts because he's a few months ahead behaviorally. 

Anyway, I think the TL;DR is he's smart so he's not falling for the distractions that work with most babies. Dying here.",beyondthebump

I will be the first to admit that I haven’t taken to motherhood like a duck to water - I had a very difficult pregnancy which involved months of bed rest which took a real toll on my energy levels. I have struggled to cope with the exhaustion and 24 hour nature of the job as my husband farms so is limited in how much support he can give me. To add more difficulty I am 4.5 months pregnant due to time pressure from my ovarian cancer. My son has been a terrible sleeper since he was born (waking every 45 mins or hourly without fail) and now at 7.5 months he has given us a six-hour stretch two nights in a row. I’m not confident that this will continue but the difference it has made is unbelievable! Every morning since he was born I have told my son how much I love him which is true, but I was worried about how much I disliked motherhood itself. This morning however, as I played with him on the sofa, I couldn’t help but finish my ‘I love you’ sentence with ‘and I love being your mummy’. And I genuinely meant it.

907,I’m having a sad day,"I just had my baby boy, Riley, on Tuesday. He is currently being transferred to the children’s hospital, because the pediatrician at the hospital I had him at suspects he has Hirschsprungs Disease. 

I had it as a baby/child (the surgery they give to babies didn’t work for me), and it’s a Gastro issue. The first question I asked when I was in the recovery room was “how soon should he poop?” Because the last thing I wanted him to have is Hirschsprungs. He has pooped, but he also has spit up and doesn’t eat very well. 

The nurse was in my room this morning and she recognized that something was wrong, and took him to the nursery. A few hours later, he was in the nicu because I had gestational diabetes and he wasn’t eating and they didn’t want his blood sugar to get low. 

When they decided to transport him to the children’s hospital (it’s literally across the street), my nurse called my doctor to see if they could discharge me early (I had a c-section and usually you have to stay 48 hours after at this hospital) so I could be with him at the children’s hospital. 

I’m just so sad. I didn’t want my kid to go through what I went through, and he just might. Luckily, he is at the best children’s hospital in our city, and the progressions made for this disorder have greatly improved in the last 32 years. 

I’m just so sad.",beyondthebump
908,I feel like my postpartum hormones are going to ruin my life,"I'm nearly 11 months postpartum and am combination feeding breast milk and formula so my periods have returned but really erratically, along with some insane hormonal mood swings.

So its only lasting a few days but its so bad. 

Saying its hormones sounds like an excuse but I'm not excusing anything I'm just not sure what to do, I went to the GP (uk) and they just said it would even out eventually and if it gets worse try antidepressants or the pill...  i don't know... anyone else gone through this?",beyondthebump

913,Processing that I have a child,"Dear group,
I gave birth two weeks ago at week 38. I was convinced the baby would be late, so I was shocked when my water broke in the middle of the night and a few hours later my little one was born. I am not sure why, but since then I feel like I can’t believe he is really here. It feels like I just found out I was pregnant yesterday. I get overwhelmed thinking how much I want to give him everything and see him grow up, but also I somehow feel detached, like it isn’t real. I am in a good mood in general and really do not feel like I have baby blues or something like that, but still I would love to be more attached and in love with my baby. It doesn’t help that my little one was “born sleepy” and has jaundice so since day one we have to feed him every 2-3 hours and keep him awake during the feed. This has been exhausting, as it’s also accompanied by worries about his weight gain and in the end, feels like a chore. Not sure if that contributed to my feelings. Has anyone struggled with similar feelings or has some advice to share?",beyondthebump
914,Split up night feeds while EBF,"We’re a few weeks away from having our second kid (toddler is 2.5 yo) and are trying to figure out how we can best guarantee a minimum amount of quality sleep for each parent. With LO1 I did all night feeds for months which was brutal and definitely exacerbated my PPD/PPA so I’m hoping we can find a better solution this time.

My idea was that we do shifts where I sleep 9pm-1 or 2am and then DH sleeps 1-2am-7am. I would pump once during the day so DH has a bottle to give LO2 while I sleep. I didn’t have supply issues with LO1 so I’m hoping that even though engorgement is gonna be brutal for a bit, hopefully my body will adjust to this one skipped night feed so I can get that one 4-5 hour chunk.

My question, has anyone done this successfully right from the start? I’ve read the recommendation that you shouldn’t pump for 6 weeks until supply is established but then other sources say that’s outdated advice. I know it hinges on a lot of things (will baby take a bottle, how often do they wake up, milk supply is different with each kid… etc) but am just looking for others’ experiences with a plan like this, positive or negative. Thanks!

916,Why do people care about my business so much??,"My fiancé and I have a really big couch in the living room, two gaming setups, a playpen, and a pack n play for the baby to sleep in. The bathroom and kitchen is right down the hall. The living room is nice and cold in the summer and the bedroom that is all the way upstairs is hot as hell. So my fiancé and I sleep in the living room a lot of nights, he likes to stay up late to play video games anyways and I like being close to him when I sleep, the baby sleeps right by him and he does everything for her at night since he’s already up. We also like watching tv shows together and just falling asleep on the couch, it’s easier too because we can walk right down the hallway to get the baby a bottle or food or get stuff to clean a mess. The bathroom is right there too. It’s just easier for us, whenever someone finds out that we don’t usually sleep in our bedroom they get so shocked and judgmental, like how could we possibly be engaged and not sleep in the same bed every night or omg how do you have sex!? Like you can have sex on a couch or literally anywhere but whatever.  We’ve had family members ask that before, like how we’re able to have sex. Why is that someone’s business???",beyondthebump

918,Getting sick / immune system question.,"Dear mom and dads of beyondthebump, 
 I am fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my 16month old full time, so no daycare or babysitters. We honestly don’t get out much at all around people because Florida is a Covid cesspool and I trust no one. I take him to the park once in a while, otherwise he just runs around of neighborhood, or the tennis court since there’s a gate and he can’t escape, lol. One of my anxiety ridden fears is me getting him sick. Rationally I know that he **will** get sick eventually, but *knock on wood* hasn’t even had a sniffle in 16 months. I thank my breast milk, vitamins, a decent diet and ungodly amount of Lysol wipes for that. Nevertheless my husband keeps saying “we need to expose him, we need to let him get sick to build his immune system” — My fear now is that it has been so long that when he does get sick … he’s going to get **sick**. 

So my question, is that the case? Did you have a LO that when finally got sick it was pretty bad, or just normal cold? Anything I can do to encourage a healthy immune system without having to get him sick? 

Sincerely, nervous mama.",beyondthebump

2)are your kids drinking from a sippy cup? Open cup? Cup with straw?  We have twins so open cup is way too labor intensive and messy for us. Our kids do water from a cup with straw. And sippy cup for milk. Once in awhile, milk from a straw cup. We also use 360 cup for water sometimes.

920,Generational effects,"I've been thinking about my grandfather lately, my mom's dad, that is. He was a fun grandpa, and I'd hoped he was a good dad too, but I didn't know how good until recently. My mom and I were talking about the fact that my husband is very involved and then some in our daughter's life, and my mom said, ""It's a tradition, I tell ya.""

""What do you mean?""

""Your grandfather was almost always the one to take all of us places so that your nana could have time for herself. It was a great adventure for him, packing all seven of us and getting on the road. And in your case, of course, your dad was home with you while he was finishing his degree and looking for a job.""

I guess it makes sense - in seeing Grandpa take care of everyone, my mom would have known she wouldn't marry someone who wasn't at least as involved, and by extension, I saw the same example with my own dad and knew the kind of man I wanted to be with. My grandpa was a goof sometimes, but he knew what was important. For a father of a huge brood of kids in the 60's and 70's, that's no small thing. It's nice to think that because one man said to himself, ""No, I'm not gonna be that dad who shoves everything off on his wife"", my kid will have a secure relationship with her own father.",beyondthebump
921,I feel like an absolute idiot 😭,"My baby just turned 1 in July. I know she should be eating more food but I've been struggling with her appetite even before her birthday. She'll only eat about 2oz of food a day, on good days closer to 3oz. On bad days she wouldn't eat anything so she was just getting formula/milk. Since her birthday I've been switching her off formula to milk. She loves milk so some days she would just drink milk. When I googled how to switch babies to milk it failed to mention or at least I didn't see that you're only supposed to give them 16oz of milk a day. Before her birthday she was having three 8oz bottles of formula a day along with breast milk. So I was giving her the same 24oz of milk a day. Her poop's been almost white and I was worried and asking her doc about it. She didn't seem super concerned based on what I told her but I was still concerned so I googled more. That's when I discovered I've been feeding her too much milk and with the tiny amount of food she eats she was basically on the road to becoming anemic. I feel like that should have just been basic knowledge but I genuinely had no idea so I feel like an absolute idiot. Hopefully lowering the amount of milk she drinks will make her more willing to eat more food and also get her poop back to a normal color.",beyondthebump

She went to daycare Monday and Tuesday, and spiked a 102.5 fever Tuesday night. She's had a fever since.

Her pediatrician does not seem concerned at all really that in the past 3.5 months my daughter has had a fever for a total of 70+ days. She says children in daycare are always sick.

I feel like something is seriously wrong, either the daycare is filthy or our daughter has some more sinister underlying condition. She's only been well enough to attend daycare for a few days each month, how do parents hold down jobs if this is normal?

934,15 week old sleep?," 

FTM, feeling overwhelmed and confused, and hoping to help my LO (15 weeks old) get the rest he needs. He has slept up to about 4-5 hrs in a stretch, but not consistently. Lately we have been doing bath at 6:30, followed by boob and bed at 7. LO consistently wakes up at 7:45, seemingly confusing bedtime for a nap. He usually goes down well after that with a little boob, and gets his longest stretch of the night, up to about 3-3.5 hours. After that things fall apart, with him waking every 2 hours screaming. The only thing that seems to calm him is boob. Path of least resistance has been to take him from his crib into our bed around 2am, and feed him in side lying when he wakes up every 2 hours. He is always up at 6am. Not sure if this is playing into it, but I have had a lot of trouble spacing out daytime feeds. LO seems to want to eat (at minimum) every 2 hours. I am able to at times stretch to 2.5 hours, but never more than that. Feeling very nervous overwhelmed, and tired- any advice much appreciated. 

Naps throughout the day are variable: usually a solid two hour contact nap in the morning, followed by two to three 45-60 minute naps in his crib. Last nap always finished by about 5.

Should also add: LO was born SGA, growing great and doc is not concerned, but still &gt;10th percentile for weight. Perhaps not relevant, but might be playing into his frequent feedings and limiting long stretches of sleep?",beyondthebump

Yesterday was a break in our rough routine and at 8pm I couldn’t keep her awake any longer, she fell asleep and I couldn’t wake her up enough for a proper feed.

I also don’t know if this is just my crazy mom brain (hello PPA!) or something that others have experienced/felt and if so, how you handled it. 

Now just for some background, yes my baby is cute for a baby. Even the doctor who delivered her said “I see lots of babies and I can tell you, that’s a cute baby”. So from day 1 we’ve heard it. 

And at first I really liked hearing it. I enjoyed smiling with people awwing over the cuteness of my brand new baby. But now that she’s a little older, we hear it everywhere we go, and I’m just so awkward with response. Strangers will see her and comment  “now that’s a cute baby!” and “omg she’s absolutely beautiful” and I just awkwardly laugh and say “haha thanks, yea she is”. Or even worse, I’ll post her on my IG and I’ll get comments saying how perfect and doll like she is, and Idk how to respond. I know people are just being super friendly and think that’s what I/she wants to hear.

Is this normal? Lol… I mean I’m super grateful she’s a cute baby, and I love her to death obviously, but I wasn’t expecting to feel this way. Has anyone else felt like this?

-let them explore the baby's room/ furniture

For context I'm 18, I had my daughter when I was 17 and she's going to be a year old in September. I have a rant and idk if this is the right place but I don't know where else to go. 

Okay so I got my first full-time job at 15, moved out at 16 and have been fully supporting myself since then. When I got the positive pregnancy test I had just turned 17 so my mom convinced me to move to the same town as her so she could help (spoiler,,, I hate it here) i got a one year lease with the intent of moving back as soon as it ended. Well when it came time there were barely any listings but we had to give notice..that was June. I have been staying at my mom's house since then, in a very small room with my daughter and my partner. My grandparents also live here, and my three you get brothers. There's no storage lockers available so my shit is stacked in the living room. I. Am. Going. Crazy. 

Nobody wants to rent to me because of my age even though I have a daughter and a partner and we've been supporting ourselves for years, have great references, have never missed a payment for ANYTHING. But landlords don't give a sh*t about us. My partner just had to leave and stay with a friend because she needed to start her job in the city and now my daughter and I are living away from her and can visit about once a week. My grandparents were abusive af (mentally) growing up and I lived with them for five years so that fucked m up, and they're not better now. I am constantly biting my tongue so my daughter doesn't have to deal with constant arguing, my grandma says some self-centered narcissistic shit every five minutes I swear. 

I don't even know what to do anymore, we've applied everywhere and half of them don't even get back to us, I've been left on read so many times or never heard back when trying to schedule a viewing. My daughter doesn't get to play or eat how she used to (there's always distractions from her food so it's really hard to get her to eat enough) I don't eat how I used to because I don't get the opportunity to even cook and everything I do is somehow wrong and I'm being yelled at, like I'm 8 again. I am staying in the same room I was when I was 15, where I got SA'd multiple times, where I self-harmed everyday and attempted s*icide multiple times. On top of it my therapist isn't qualified for my trauma, my mostly absent father is visiting 🙄🙄 and I'm so f*cked up from my previous chronic pain which was made so much worse by pregnancy that when my parental leave is up I can't go back to work. Oh and as soon as my partner left my daughter started getting another tooth in. It's like I'm all alone again, 15 years old and barely hanging on yet having to wake up every morning and push through to the end of the day...but this time with the added pressure of a child depending on me. I have suspected bpd and ADHD (working on diagnoses now that I'm 18) and lately its like the universe is working against me and I know I just think that because of my disorder but it's so hard. Everytime I'm at the bottom I get pushed down even further. 

I am working on getting someone more qualified for my problems and I just started a new antidepressant but I feel like I'm in some hell equivalent and I'm trapped...just by being alive. 
I've always had problems with my mental health and now that I'm a parent I just feel so guilty and overwhelmed with it, I have to actively avoid turning to self destructive behavior and keep myself from breakdowns which is sO HARD when you have basically no emotional regulation.

951,Baby won't stop sucking his fist,"My 12 week old baby just won't stop sucking on his fist.... and then plastering his drool all over his face when he touches his face with those fists. I tried to wipe his hands clean whenever I can, but honestly, I think it's a losing battle.

Is this a precursor to baby sucking his thumb? I originally thought maybe it might be a hunger cue, but he does this all the time regardless of whether he's been fed. Also, is there anything I can do for some small red bumps on his cheeks and chin that I think is the starting of drool rash?",beyondthebump
952,Am I over feeding my 4 week old?,I was reading some stuff about formula schedules because I was concerned about how frequently my baby wad eating and saw that babies shouldn’t be taking more than 32 oz a day in formula. Also that they should be eating 2.5x their weight. Not sure his weight right now but he was 8 lb at 2 week checkup.  He has been for the last week eating 30-35 oz a day… he’s hungry every 2-3 hours even overnight. Eating anywhere from 2.5-4oz every time . I try to soothe him with a pacifier for as long as I can but I can tell he’s hungry as he starts to spits it out . He occasionally spits up but not a lot and not very often.,beyondthebump

954,Suddenly my toddler won't sleep alone!,"We used have have this wonderful daily routine with my 2.5 year old. Bedtime 730pm, wake up 730am, and nap 12-2/3. We would literally put her in her bed after our routine and say goodnight and shut the door and she would just go to sleep. For the last two weeks for literally no reason, my daughter won't stay in her room to go to bed or nap and insists on one of us to stay with her until she sleeps. There have been nights that she has been up until 11pm fighting to sleep. Even when we stay with her she gets distracted by us and laughs and plays, delaying bedtime. She now goes to bed at 9 on average every night with one of us lying with her until she falls asleep. She is still waking at the same time in the morning. She is a cranky tantrumy mess because she isn't getting enough sleep.

Her nap and after bedtime is the precious to us for multiple obvious reasons. We cannot have this become a habit. I am due with baby number two on November and having this will just make it a lot harder. 

We have tried leaving, but she cries hysterically. If she's not crying when we leave, she gets into everything and not staying in her room. We have tried cutting down her nap and even keeping her up all day, wearing her out before bed, we have even tried starting her routine later. Nothing seems to help. It is so much less of a fight to just stay with her until she sleeps. But I know the longer we do this the more ingrained this habit will get, which we do not want.

We have literally changed nothing in our bedtime routine, nothing big has happened in our life, she isn't sick. I am pregnant, but she's too young to actually understand that a sibling is coming even though we have explained it many times. I have no idea what's going on and we are so confused because she has been a champion sleeper since 6 months old. Has anyone else gone through this and have any tips?",beyondthebump
955,Never ending teething,"Our little 10.5 month old guy just finished cutting his last incisor probably a week and a half ago. I was looking forward to a few months of relief from teething, but since then, he’s still showing signs of teething. Reaches in his mouth with his fingers, winces, makes kissy face, doesn’t want to eat solids. 

I know first molars are supposed to be next but from what I’ve ready, they usually come in like 4 months after the incisors. I don’t see or feel any bumps where his molars will be. I thought maybe I could see a little white bumps where one of his canines will be, though. Is it possible he’s going to get his canines first, and so soon?

961,2 month old devouring her fingers,"Pretty much what the title says, my 2 month old daughter has her fingers in her mouth constantly and is sucking on them.

I’ve asked about it and was told that she basically just discovered her hands so she’s gonna put them in her mouth, but is there such a thing as doing it too much? I’ve tried pacifiers, she spits them out and jams her little fists back in her mouth.  Sometimes she’ll even make herself gag on her own hands! 

I assume it’s her way of self soothing, but oh my god listening to her gum her hands all night sounds like an old man eating ribs and it’s driving me batty. I took her to the doctors last week because one of her fingers looked inflamed, luckily she was fine, just had to soak her finger for a couple of days.

963,I miss my midwives,"
 Hi! I am currently 7 weeks PP and enjoying motherhood! However, I can’t help but to miss my midwives (3 work in the office so I would see them all). Due to a preterm labor scare, I was going to weekly appointments for three months. I absolutely LOVED my appointments (partly because I was on strict bed rest and the only time I left the house was for appointments, lol). 
My midwives started to feel like my friends, and it truly feels like I’m grieving the loss of a friendship. They never treated me like a paycheck. They cared, they took my concerns seriously, they were kind, and it was never “strictly business”. We would talk like friends catching up on each other’s lives.
    At my 6 week pp appointment, I talked about some PPD I was having, and my midwife cried with me. She had a heart to heart with me about how she had similar feelings. I just felt heard and cared about. All the staff was just fantastic to me. 
     I went in today to get my work release filled out, and they scheduled my yearly pap. Just like that, my pregnancy journey is all over. I’m no longer the first time pregnant mom full of excitement. I’m no longer asked how I’m feeling, no one checks on my well being. The focus is now 100% on my baby. 
In a way I feel abandoned. Since the moment I got wheeled down to the PP floor I’ve felt abandoned. 
Once I had my baby, everyone stopped caring about me. Which might be why I miss my midwives so much? Idk. They truly cared and felt like family. 
 I love my son to pieces, and I’m so glad he’s here and healthy. I’m just absolutely crushed about my pregnancy journey being over. 
  I must sound nut. I promise, I’m not. Just grieving the ending of a chapter in my book. I had such a fabulous first pregnancy, and for that I am grateful. Sorry for any typos, I’m rather emotional this evening.",beyondthebump

He’s generally in a normal mood but gets very cranky sometimes, which is unusual for him. He usually takes a mega nap in the afternoon and he’s such a happy boy. But the sickness threw everything off and hes not as happy as he usually is.

969,Car seat configurations,"Baby number 2 is coming in about 3 weeks, which means it's time to get that car seat set up!

We have a small SUV with room for both the infant car seat and the toddler car seat in the back. We always kept our first kid on the right hand side, the logic being that if we pull over and park we can spend more time on the curb getting her in and out versus trying to do it in the middle of a busy street.

I'm wondering now if it makes sense to keep her on that side and put the infant car seat behind the driver's seat or if I should switch them up. I've definitely had to wrestle the toddler in and out of the seat before so keeping her on the right side seems appealing, but does anyone know if there's a safety reason to make a change?

Three important points of clarification:
1) I'm in the US so we're mostly driving and parking on the right hand side of the road,
2) I know those middle is the safest, but unfortunately we can't put a seat in the middle with our car, and

973,I feel failed by my midwives,"So because I’m Diabetic, I had multiple specialised midwives on my case who oversaw my pregnancy, and the one thing I was constantly told throughout my pregnancy was that I needed to breastfeed - that it was important, and that I needed to do this, I didn’t have a choice.

Meaning after I gave birth, I felt like an absolute failure as I had low to zero supply. I tried everything they suggested and more to try feed my baby, whose blood sugar got so low I decided that I would supplement even though I got treated like I was poisoning her.

I had a routine check up the other day, and was speaking with my GP who mentioned, since my Dad has hyperthyroidism and it looks like I may have it too, this could be a possible reason I couldn’t supply.

Like… wtf? All the way through my pregnancy, I had blood tests at least once a month, I mentioned this to all my doctors in my family history, and no one thought to warn me? To let me know and put me on this medication which has now changed my life, which I only even went to the doctors for because I thought I had PPD and he wanted to do a full check up cause of my history???

We DO discuss different beliefs openly, but even so, I feel like sometimes it causes more confusion than it alleviates.

Unfortunately, we live in an area almost devoid of like-minded individuals, and none within our son's age group, so there's really nothing to supplement those kinds of relationships with.

981,How do you deal with Dad not being good with baby?,"Looking for advice. We have an 11 week old and he’s not a good sleeper. My husband returned to work 9 days after he was born and we have no help, so both of us are very sleep deprived. The house is in shambles and our relationship is suffering.

My husband works 6-7 days a week and started a new job just three weeks ago. He’s taking on extra work because he’s trying to make a good impression.

The first month after the baby was born he was great, but lately he has been really frustrated and impatient with me and my son.

This has resulted in my son being unsure of him. Because my husband works so much he hasn’t had as much time to bond with the baby and when he is home he’s so tired that he doesn’t give 100%. My son now won’t settle for him. He is much calmer when it is just the two of us.

If I have my husband do his bedtime bottle our son absolutely screams down the house. The same thing happens when my husband takes a night feed. The crying wakes me up and it’s really distressing. It completely defeats the purpose of having him do it in the first place. 

I try to stay away and let my husband figure it out, but he’s not very responsive. He will just let the baby cry while he does whatever he needs to do. He doesn’t offer words of comfort or try to soothe him and his frustration and impatience shows. Sometimes I end up intervening because our son gets so worked up that he can’t breathe, his face goes bright red. As soon as I start talking or take him from my husband our son calms down.

I’ve tried to offer my advice, “soothe him, speak to him, just cuddle him like this, he likes to be held like this, rub his back” etc. Sometimes in the moment my husband will take my advice but then when I’m gone he goes right back to his way. 

I don’t know what to do. I need and want them to have a better relationship both for my son and my own sanity, so I can have a break sometimes.

984,"Some reflections as a second time mom who suffered from severe PPD after my first was born, but not this time. Hint: guilt, lots of guilt.","*I apologize for any typos or grammatical issues, I’m using voice to text while my newborn naps on my shoulder.*

When I became a first time mother, I was not in a stable or healthy place in my life neither circumstantially, my relationship, nor internally within myself. I had what they call a “mother wound“, from growing up with an alcoholic mother who was abusive and I can’t while I cannot say she’s a narcissist because I’m not qualified, I’ll definitely say she seems to have narcissistic traits. I had an inferiority complex as well as depression and anxiety issues. When I became pregnant something was wrong from the start but I didn’t really understand that since I had no previous experience. The heightened hormones were not nice to me at all and I literally spent every single day crying in agony uncontrollably. I had HG as well. Something just wasn’t “right” from the start. I was having a hard time taking the abstract idea of becoming a mother and solidifying it in my mind as a thing that was going to happen to me. I had a lot of dissociation, denial, and I hate to admit it but I did engage in some behaviors that are pretty shameful for a pregnant woman to do. I was 22 years old and probably needed to be under the care of a psychiatrist but I thought these were just the “baby blues/hormones“. I thought this is what “emotional roller coaster“ meant.  Long story short for my relationship, things were rock-bottom and I felt no support from my partner. And things financially hit the fan and so I had to move back in with my parents who bring out the worst in me. Then, I had a C-section and had to recover from that while being a single mother (logistically, I lived with my parents who were no help while my boyfriend rented a room elsewhere) with no help and still suffering from intense depression. We can say things were brutal. Postpartum depression is a pretty ugly thing and I’ll just go ahead and be honest since it’s in the past, if anyone wants to judge me for it you’re judging someone who I was a couple of years ago and mentally ill, not me presently. My symptoms were extreme anger, and I began drinking. As soon as my baby would go down for a nap I would instantly go and chug a beer or two which was completely out of character for me. Sometimes I would get so angry at her crying that I had to put her in her bassinet and put her in the closet and walk away so I could just scream into a pillow and stab myself for 15 minutes. I still feel fucking horrible about it till this day but I literally didn’t know what else to do. Nothing against drinking, but it’s never been my thing and all the sudden I was secretly drinking probably five or six drinks today. I would fantasize about “unaliving“ myself. I hacked off my hair with a pair of scissors to the scalp while laughing and crying in a fit of rage/psychosis and hid in my bedroom for three days.  I thought about giving out my baby for adoption because I thought I was the worst mother who ever lived but it was such a painful thought because I really did love her but some thing was just very wrong here. I ultimately did make two attempts at unaliving myself but thankfully came to my senses at the last minute and I finally started telling people the truth about how “not okay” I was. My worst fear came true and after I told a doctor about this CPS was called and the CPS case worker did not protect my privacy whatsoever and told both my boyfriend and my parents at the doctor said I was “a little bit off“. So that was fucking humiliating and I felt like an even worse mother. But the good news is that the people around me started to realize that they needed to help me out a little bit more so thank God I was finally able to catch a little bit of a break and rest and recover and slowly but surely the darkness started to lift but it was still there looming around the corner all of the time. Not nearly as badly but I would say for at least a full year I had significant memory issues, I made some weird impulsive judgment/behaviors, all of that stuff. I say it was a very drawn out nervous break down that had peaks and valleys but never subsided for probably at least a full year postpartum. Everything about that, I thought was normal, because our society jokes about “mom brain“ etc, all stuff that I was able to somehow justify to myself as being “normal. But all of my symptoms were about 10 times as serious as what is normal and I only fully understood that once I became a second time mom a few years later, which brings us to the present. 


I became a second time Mom recently and I can’t even begin to put into words the dry Normas difference this whole pregnancy, postpartum, and motherhood experience has been. The pregnancy was a lot easier. I only vomited a couple of times in the first trimester and then never had an issue with it again whereas with my first I had HG.  I think I only had maybe two or three mood swing episodes and they weren’t even a quarter as intense as how I felt all of the time with my first. I definitely had my moody days and moments but it was on the spectrum of “normal/expected“ not mentally ill. I was able to be a stay at home mom this time so I was able to just focus on taking care of me, my toddler, and taking breaks when needed instead of trying to work myself to the bone because our society (at least the United States) gets all passive aggressive If you dare admit that working while pregnant is too hard on you. I am by no means wealthy but I do have my own residence now and that’s made a ginormous difference compared to living with my toxic parents. I had a vaginal birth this time and they recovery has been so much easier than my C-section. I know everyone has a different experience with that and all experiences are valid, but at least for me, I didn’t know what I was missing until I got to have a vaginal delivery and holy shit. I am so fucking glad I didn’t have to have a C-section. ‘Nuff said. Postpartum, things were just… They were totally different. Technically things are harder this time because I’m taking care of a newborn plus a toddler but even though circumstantially things are harder somehow things are just so much more easy. I’m not really sure how else to say that but everything that people claimed would be “instinct”, second nature, I actually feel that this time. I feel confident, capable, and things of actually been going really smoothly introducing my toddler to the new baby. I actually feel like I’m rocking this Mom thing. When my baby cries, I don’t feel angry or worked up. It doesn’t really phase me or I feel empathetic but still calm and in control. Her crying doesn’t affect me (which I hope doesn’t sound bad, I mean that in a good way). Don’t get me wrong, I have had that good old sleep deprived crabbiness and I have been a little bit irritable toward my partner, but there’s a huge difference between irritable/touchy which is normal for the baby blues, and being a psycho rage monster which I was with postpartum depression the first time.

So that’s all really good and don’t get me wrong I’m not complaining! I am super relieved and having a “normal“ postpartum experience has been really healing… But it piles on the mom guilt in sanely. Every single thing I do with my newborn I trigger repressed memories of when my first was a baby and I have spent time crying and wishing I could have a do over so that I could be her mom again and raise her again as this confident, healthy, stable, empathetic mother and not the monster she got. Thank God my toddler is extremely healthy, happy, outgoing, and has a secure attachment and is always laughing/smiling. I was genuinely terrified that my mental health issues would ruin her life from the start but it seems like despite having me for a mom back then, she is turning out just fine anyway. But oh my God I feel so bad for the way I treated her sometimes. When she was crying and I would get so mad I had to put her in the closet and walk away. When I considered giving her up for adoption because I thought I was going to ruin her life. When I chose to sleep train her because I was so short on fumes and so dissociated I couldn’t think of a better way to teach her how to sleep. All regrets I have. All very un-motherly/not very loving. She deserved better. 

But I know that that just wasn’t “me“. It was a nasty mental illness and it wasn’t exactly something I can control. What I needed was more support from those around me and it makes me a little bit sad to know that they weren’t there for me in my time of need but I’ll think about that some other time. Right now I’m just trying to soak up all the newborn snuggles and enjoy how happy and thriving my older girl is despite her rocky infancy. I still have remorse and regrets, however. If I could get one magical do-over in life, I wish I could go back to when my first was a newborn and take care of her as well as I am taking care of her younger sister.",beyondthebump

991,Drug addiction is mainly caused by mental health care not being easily accessible,"






Depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are common among drug addicts. That’s because mental health treatment isn’t easily accessible. People think all drug addicts are useless scum, when there are some who are just trying to self medicate. Some people are out on the waiting list for a year before they are allowed to see a professional, mainly because they have crappy insurance and the clinics have a waiting list. I was one of those people. I have bipolar disorder and spent a year in jail for drugs. I was only trying to self medicate and never harmed anyone.",beyondthebump
992,Head lag at 4 months,"My 4 month old failed the head lag test at her 4 month check up last week when the doc gave her the pull to sit test.

The doctor said headlag should be completely gone by now and wants to refer us to a specialist. I’m incredibly worried, especially after what I have read on Google!! 

Her head control is otherwise fine. She holds her head up well during tummy time. She’s rolled both front to back and back to front a few times. We definitely don’t do as much tummy time as we should. Socially she’s very engaged with constant smiles and eye contact.

The only thing that settles him at night is nursing. I've tried to let him cry in the past without success, and he shares a room with his older sister so I'm hesitant to try it again. I have tried to go in and rub his back to soothe him back to sleep, but that hasn't worked either.  He falls asleep just fine at the beginning of the night it's just these wake ups.

995,"Parents of newborns with reflux, how do you get sleep while also following safe sleep recommendations?","Tired of holding my baby upright for 30 minutes after he eats in the middle of the night, only to have him wake up choking on spit up shortly thereafter and having to drag myself out of bed to deal with that while I’m half asleep, often multiple times per feeding.

I also can’t nap in the day now because he does most of his sleeping during upright time so when I finally put him down, there’s only enough time for me to sleep that I wake up groggy when he wants to eat again. (Some if this has to do with the fact that unless he is held for his entire nap, he wants to eat about 30 minutes after being put down)

997,"Choosing the right stroller has been a frustrating experience, any advice?","I looked through so many strollers and choosing a stroller travel system with a car seat and bassinet has been a frustrating experience.

Finally settled on the Maxi-Cosi Zelia, it has everything I need, but removing/detaching the car seat in and out of the car requires both hands and aligning the seat with the frame adapters can be difficult. Unlike the Graco models that allow you to do it more easily, but the quality of everything overall seems worse.

Does anyone have any experience with this particular Zelia model? 

Another option I was considering was to just buy a stroller/bassinet and keep the car seat installed in the car. But this would mean transferring the baby each time from car seat to bassinet/stroller. Does anyone do it this way?

Maybe you have some insights on a simpler solution?

1004,Over reacting or being ignored?,"So my day starts like this. I wake up, husband's already pissed off because he has 1 day to sleep in and the cat woke him up early. He starts out by bitching about the cat and I tell him to be quiet because he will wake the baby. He gets more mad and the baby wakes up, thankfully in a great mood. I go upstairs with baby and put cartoons on while I make some food (it distracts him or he becomes inconsolable once he sees the bowl) hubby comes up stairs and starts commenting on how early the baby is awake. I tell him it's because we were loud. He becomes more mad. He starts nit picking. This is the worst. He keeps going on little things until I blow up then he back pedals and makes me feel like I'm over reacting??? He said ""if he really napped 4 hours like you said then he wouldn't have been so tired last night and he would of stayed up till his normal bed time. So maybe you slept 4 hours but he didn't."" 
So let me get this straight. You're blaming me for our child waking up earlier because you wouldn't stop bitching? And the worst of it all, your calling me a bad mom ontop of it? Then when I lose it saying I woke up before him and I slept within 2 feet of the baby monitor turned on full volume I'd know if he woke up, my hubby just yells back ""you only ever hear what you want to hear. If I thought you were a bad mom I'd straight up fucking tell you, you're a bad mom."" 
That escalated into me telling him he's being an asshole and him telling me to go fuck myself infront of our 15month old son so im currently sitting downstairs by myself. He is an amazing father but I feel like he's done with me im not sure what to do anymore. It's to expensive for me to live here and have my son by myself but if I moved away with my baby it'd go against everything I stand for with wanting my son to know his father and wanting him to have a relationship with his son. My hubby wouldn't move with me even right now... he doesn't even want to come with me to another province to meet most of my family...
Am I over reacting? Because I feel like getting told I slept while my baby did nothing in his crib for 3 hours (im 100% sure he got atleast an hour but now I'm feeling crazy) constitutes as being a bad mom... unless you're super tired which I was not. I would have woken at the slightest roll over like I constantly do 6 feet away from the monitor. I'm really tired of being invalidated and having all my hard work ignored but mistakes brought to light in an instant. I work hard to clean and cook and make schedules, then at 6:30pm I go to work till midnight and get up at 5 or 6am the next day... I also maintain 2 fishtanks, a litter box and now a fucking hamster cage because he wanted one. Sometimes I sleep till 8, not often. Weekends I don't work I'm getting woken up by him and baby at 9am and if I sleep till noon even if I worked past midnight the day before, i get ringed out for it. He makes me feel like I'm a bum and wasting the day....in reality I'm just tired and depressed...I'm feeling overworked and hated by my husband.... I'm not really sure how to fix it anymore or if it's even worth fixing. He never listens to anything I say to the point where we fought for a week when we were carless (neither of us could work) about him going to 401 auto because they literally are the only place that deals with bad credit here and they told me they would accept him but not me, meaning we could only get a car through him. I damaged my credit trying at so many places before HIS AUNT brought him into 401 and told him to try.... low and behold we pick up HIS car Saturday. But any time I told him he could he just shot back with a tone that made me wanna cry and say shit like ""You don't fucking get it"" or ""you don't understand"" or ""you have no idea what you're talking about nobody will accept my credit"" and I didn't even get an apology for when he got a car. When I said ""so I told you that you could get one through them"" he just shot me a look that said shut up and he later said that it's a miracle that he even got one through them and I should just be grateful?? I'd be grateful if you ever noticed or thanked me for even half the shit I do for you...",beyondthebump

Someone even said if we were such great parents the baby would be crawling by now. 
According to my baby books he’s been on target for everything, and he’s enjoying life and doing so many new things! I just feel offended, I don’t even want to bring the baby around for any criticism on him or my partner and I. I feel my relationship is about to change with a lot of people.

This is just based on them comparing their babies to mine. It’s so frustrating to constantly be scrutinized about the baby. I’ve told them he’s fine, he’s on target according to our baby book and they keep mentioning it. It’s our first baby they treat us like idiots, they think they are experts because they had babies and keep trying to control what we do with our baby and always passing judgments or giving medical advice (to add, it’s usually outdated and dangerous). I have my baby around his family for everyone to build a bond not for this. I’m dreading to see them. If anyone went through anything similar, what did you do?

1011,Anger Management - I Feel Like Crap,"Hi everyone - I ask for no judgements here but please, advice. 

I have a 2.5 month old I adore. I love him to death. He looks like a model Gerber baby and gets nothing but compliments. He’s tall(90th percentile), a little chubbs, and handsome. He is my absolute world. 

But I hurt us. 

I lost my temper last Thursday. The day before, I had my first Therapy appointment in 2 years. 

When I was younger (12), I had a really bad temper. I often felt misunderstood by my mother, who never explained what I would do wrong at this age. I broke things, stabbed walls, and beat the snot out of anything I could lay hands on, even my sibling at that age. (At least she had a pillow or two I gave her). I often feel like this didn’t help future beginnings.

I’m now 22. I am a tattoo artist. I went back to work post-3wks because I love my job and we can come and go as we please there. My boss is great. 
Me and my son’s dad have been fighting a lot over stupid things and things I would never normally be so pissed off about. I clean, I work more (make more money), and get the most fussy three hours of our son out of the day that he has him. (5pm-8pm) Of course we have our schedule of daily walk, feed, bath, bedtime, etc. 
He is the happiest baby. Smiles at everyone and everything. He’s going to be the biggest sweetheart when he gets older - I don’t know how he can get sweeter.

Last Thursday he was EXTRA fussy. Randomly scream crying, I would check for everything wrong and tried everything I could to get him to calm down and nothing was working as if he was a super extra new young baby all over again. 
I was getting irritated. I flopped him onto his crib pillow and would hold him super tight. He kept pulling and grabbing my hair/necklace. I was patting his thigh until I “pat him too hard” and he started screaming bloody murder. I then decided to go get him another bottle at this point to try again after these 15-30 minutes and I set him down. He pulled and yanked my hair so hard I smacked his hand away. Again, he screamed even worse. I got his bottle and he calmed down and I of course cried my guts out right next to him. I’m always thinking about it. I’m a terrible mother and I’m terrified to tell my therapist, I don’t want him to be taken away. I told his father and he was understanding as he knows this is more of my PPD in action and not *me*, but that’s no excuse for me. 

I was getting irritated today but I have been giving myself motivational methods. Today we had a great day and I sung him to sleep for a nap. We took a long bath, met a new friend outside today, and he eventually was so “milk-drunk”, he passed out in his Boppy with me. I love him to death but I never want to be like this again.

1013,Did I mess my kid up,"This pandemic has been insane. All the plans went out the window! My kid was born late 2019 and I was still on maternity leave when COVID first hit. I never went back to work. I couldn’t have family help, I couldn’t get a babysitter, I couldn’t travel to see my parents and indeed I was scared I’d never see them again (mom is a nurse).

My husband works full time from home and it took a toll on both of us as individuals. And as a couple, we’ve just managed to crawl our way back to romantic life. 

I used to work (a lot) as a coping mechanism for my ADD. When other people have organized my day, I do well. So I worked. And worked and worked. 

Now I have a 20 month old. It has been 20 months of feeling stressed, feeling guilty. My kid has reached every milestone and more so why do I ask myself nearly everyday if I’ve ruined everything by not doing x,y,z? Did I let her watch too much TV too soon? How come she’s screaming when I’ve fed her and she’s napped? Does she hate me? 

I just feel constantly like I’m messing up even when there’s seemingly nothing wrong. Yes, actually, people mention how lucky I should feel being a SAHM but the truth is it is really hard when you can’t get help and you’re constantly frightened of a virus that could end your life (i have an autoimmune issue), or worse, your child’s. No taking her to the stores, the mall, on errands, none of that. 

I take her to the park twice a day even when it rains because I don’t know how else to make her day nice. And now the delta variant is threatening to quash my dreams of daycare. I want her to have the company of other children and the chance to learn.

I also am a people pleaser so I don’t want to ruffle feathers but I also don’t want to compromise my baby’s health. I feel lost and I don’t know what to do and my anxiety is just so high.

1016,Are we jerks for not attending a full family birthday party of 20+ people?,"My wife and I had our first baby 10 months ago. We had just started to see family in gathering for birthday parties etc soon after we were vaccinated.

I have 3 sisters, all with husbands and kids. Two of them are very conservative and anti Covid vaccinations--both for themselves as well as their kids.

We kind of ignored that initially since my wife and I had been vaccinated, enjoying our time back in the fold. 

However, with Delta and all we have started rethinking things. With those two sisters, their anti vaccination families account for over half of the 20+ person family. One sister has 5 kids and the other has 2. Thinking about that proposition with cases rising and all made us uncomfortable with a birthday party indoors with them all this weekend (unmasked of course). 

My mom is livid. She was vaccinated but has since agreed more with the anti vax crowd. She is not guilting us about it and saying we are paranoid.

Are we being overly paranoid? I know the odds of our baby getting Covid severely and being hospitalized are low. But it seems like being vaccinated is a no brainer and an unnecessary risk for us to be indoors with so many unvaccinated people.",beyondthebump

1020,I need some advice :/ (long ish),"Two things sorta, but first a little context. Im currently almost 37 weeks along, only found out I was pregnant early last month. I'm not keeping the baby, I am no where near ready to be a mother, let alone a good one. Im only 19, been sheltered my whole life and only just got the means to start being my own person and really live. The dads not in the picture and I dont want him to be. I still live with my parents- the environment is one I long to leave and certainly not one Id want to bring a baby into even if I wanted to.

So, adoption is the best option. The agency has been more supportive than my own family, and I've already found in this short time a lovely couple who I strongly believe will give this baby girl a wonderful love filled life. Ive been filling out the necessary paperwork, it asks me to write down how I feel about being contacted by her when she reaches adulthood-

I dont know what to say, I feel awful when my first thought is I hope she doesnt. Not in a bad way, I just hope shes so happy with her adoptive parents that she doesnt feel the need to find her birthmother. 

Im going to dip my toes in trying an open adoption at first, I know no matter I'd like a few photos of the little girl in her first year. But other than that, right now I dont think I want to be involved. I dont feel any desire to, no real attachment, I wouldnt say this has been anything other than traumatic. I feel like I'm forfeiting my right to motherhood, not that I ever wanted this now anyway.

I wouldnt say that I never want her to contact me and forbid it, its also not like in this day and age she couldnt find me anyway. Just, as I said, I hope she doesnt. But if she wants to she can and I wouldnt object. I dont know how I'll feel a month from now, let alone 18 years. 

How should I articulate my thoughts into words on paper? In a way where I dont seem unemotional and cold. I just want whats best for her whether or not I wanted her and I know I could never give her the love an expantant mother would.

Okay then lastly and not so deep, I am beyond terrified to give birth. I can ask for nitrous oxide to help me stay calm while they hook me up to the iv and epidural right? My anxiety goes through the roof and I have fainted when I have to do blood work or have an iv, needles are normally fine but a giant one down my spine or whatever? on top of already an iv and serious pain? fucking nah. 

Im hoping the pain from labor will be more than enough to make say fuck it just help me and get it done, but I just cannot imagine any scenario where I could do that without freaking out. Ive always figured Id sooner die than get hooked up to a buncha tubes or need major surgery etc etc. I just cannot, Im so freaking scared.

Not to mention that pain and bleeding post delivery can last up to a month or more?? I had no idea. Please 🥲 Im miserable enough",beyondthebump
1021,My son is 3 and I still can not get over the way his dad treated me while I was pregnant,"I am 22 years old and my son will be 3 this Halloween. I am married to his father, who is 35.

I got pregnant when I was just 18 years old. He was 32. We only dated about a month before I found out I was pregnant but we talked about everything and he said he wanted to spend his life with me. We looked at apartments together and he was pretty supportive. It just all was too much for me and I felt like I was being completely rushed into everything by moving this fast. I already had a baby on the way with him but we had SO many differences. I just really got fed up of trying to communicate with someone who never even seemed to want to make any effort to fix our issues. So we broke up constantly. I finally broke up with him and we agreed to remain friends, and just focus on the baby. He said he loved me and just wanted to be a good dad. He said he wasn’t going to be dating and would stay single and still be there during my pregnancy.

2 weeks later- he gets another girlfriend (someone id have no where near my child) and puts me through a custody battle with an attorney his girlfriend of a few weeks recommended. He came to no more appointments, gave me a hard time about buying baby supplies knowing I was just 18 (but could spend money on his girlfriend) he was completely uninterested in my pregnancy other than causing stress. It got so bad the OB wrote a letter stating if the stress didn’t stop, I could lose our child. I couldn’t even call him on the phone without him letting his girlfriend listen in or record me. I was so stressed out. He even sued me to be in the delivery room despite not being around and being with another woman. This actually made the news headlines because it only ever happened one other time in the entire US. 
He ended up dumping the woman the month our son was due and I’ll admit, I got back together with him because I was afraid of more legal issues or him trying to continue to bring women he barely knew into our sons life. 

I have had chronic health issues since I gave birth. My periods are so bad I was given the option of a hysterectomy at just 20 years old. I developed HYPER POTS (my nervous system doesn’t work right) and for an entire year I became agoraphobic (I’m still working on that) I haven’t drove my own car or left the house alone in over a year. 

I am a stay at home mom and I feel so stupid for being hung up on things from years ago. But I see videos online of men holding their partners hand while they give birth, or being there to help with the child afterwards. He completely crushed me and pregnancy was so hard on my body. I feel like I’ll never be the same again. As much as I love being a mom I never knew this was going to happen to me.  My health and my identity is gone..",beyondthebump

Due to some personal health issues I have become really underweight. Up until this point, I have EBF my 9 MO son. However, my boy is on the small side and is not getting enough fat or calories from my milk anymore, so we have decided to supplement with formula. I fortunately already have six different brands of bottles to try, but so far he isn't really interested in any of them. He kind of treats them like teethers.

1028,Cheap + Entertaining Motor Skill Practice,"My son rarely plays with the toys we or others bought him. He prefers the things around the house we don't want him to play with! He now has a decoy remote and a decoy mouse. So I wasn't really wanting to buy more toys that practice fine motor skills since he only occasionally plays with any of them. The other night I gave him some carrot slivers and noticed he was pushing them into the straw hole of an empty cup I had on the table. I let him play with that while I made dinner. 

Then, I took the plastic lid from an empty jar and cut a wide slot in it and gave him cheerios. He spent a hilarious half hour carefully dropping them in. It got even better when he realized the zigzag straw from the night before made AMAZING sounds when he pushed it into the slot. 

Today, I cut a quarter sized hole in the top of a yogurt quart and gave him some medium sized colored pom poms from the craft store. We spent the day practicing our colors while he put them in the yogurt container. When he dumped out the bag later we practiced cleaning up and putting them in the container. It was a great way to entertain him and practice those skills without spending more than three dollars.

1031,Am I making the wrong decision?,"I’ve lived in minnesota the last 15 years. And all I’ve wanted was to get out. It’s isolated, the winters are awful, etc. but I met my husband ten years ago, have since made good friends (some have left) and become comfortable. I had my daughter here in 2019 and had the worst birth and even worse PPD. I couldn’t have survived without my parents, inlaws and my husbands aunt who all live nearby. In November of last year we got an opportunity for a transfer finally. At the time my parents were relocating out to Maryland for work (we both have siblings in the dc area), his parents agreed to follow, and the housing market wasn’t as crazy.  By the time the move was accepted in March, my dad had been laid off and my inlaws decided against moving because they’ve been here their whole lives. We got transfers for both our positions which is super rare. But all along I’ve had reservations. We are comfortable here: baby sitting (although my parents are still moving to the  dc area because my other siblings are there), daycare is 5 minutes away, things are close by, etc. I’ve been trying to tell my minnesota born husband To stay here for now. A lot of it too is because I decided I want a second kid and it seems it would be easier to have the kid here. My husband took a while to get on board with moving but once he did he embraced it and saw the benefits : living near his brother and his family, his parents said they will get a second home there, More things to do, a more cultural experience etc. we did finally find a house (still have time to back out) after a grueling process of getting outbid. But I am just discontent and super sad. Am I being emotional? I feel bad for my spouse, he’s been dealing with my ups and downs and this originally wasn’t something he even wanted!

1044,Im having thoughts of suicide.,"My husband is the only one that works and he won't get a job that pays more, he's gone a long time but won't get a better job. He works far. We live on a property that my mom rents for cheap, some lady took advantage of us by saying that CPS was going to take her daughter if she didn't find a spot to park her RV, my stepdad wanted to help and so they let her rent a space. It's been almost a year, she said just for the winter months. People coming in going out, her power went out it escalated to me telling her to leave today. We gave her more than a month, no need to pay is any rent to use it for a lot rental. I made a comment about ""the day is bright"" in regards to her not being able to move if she didn't have power. She said ""you making some kinda joke out of me girl?"" I snapped told her ""please have your things out by tomorrow, thank you"" over text it was 2 am, I was tired had just put my 6 month old to sleep and she calls. Well she flipped said she would call the city, county commissioner have us all evicted because the house that were at isn't permitted to work on but we fixed dit up anyway because our landlord let us. Texted my stepdad said she was gonna light the burn pile on fire for the fire department to come and see how we ""got her"" as in no water and without electricity because the breaker clicked off because her AC pulls too much electricity. 

Went to the cops they can't do anything to get her RV out. If we go to the sheriff's well have to include our landlord and then we really will get evicted, I don't have residency, we are working on it. Passed the first step of it all. So if we get evicted I can't work and my husband doesn't get paid enough to support us and rent somewhere. Anyway, I didn't get any sleep all night. I've been so stressed. I can't protect my son. My husband said something to me while I was talking to my parents  I didn't hear him(he got mad that I didn't hear him but he was the one asking what I said) until he threw a fit and walked away I asked him what he said saying that I was tired and my brain was slow, what he said I was barely processing while he was walking away. In a rude way he says ""you slept for 2 hours!"" Which mind you I didn't I slept 1 that he let me sleep because I accidentally fell asleep getting the baby to nap. I had been moving and throwing things away in case the city did come I want to make sure my baby is okay. 

Well I'm laying my baby down when we get home and I'm crying, my husband holds me and I start crying even harder because I realize how fucking shit my life is and how I don't want to live it anymore, there's no point. I just worry and stress, there's no money I can't work, my husband bought a nice car that is over budget and waste gas like no tomorrow. I'm hysterically crying now and he lets go pushes himself up and yells ""I'm sorry IM SUCH A SHIT DAD AND SHIT HUSBAND IM LEAVING TO GO TO WORK"" he left me there, crying my eyes out he didn't care. I just want to die, Its too much, being poor is too much, having my son is too much and being with my husband is too much I just want to end it, I just want to feel the relief of not having to worry about anything or anyone I just want out. I'm done. 

We.went.to marriage counseling and nothing of what he said he would do and that he could do has he done but I've done my part on point and have even done more that enough I've given 200% and he's given none. He has ADD and the counselor said in a relationship with an ADD person the one without add will be doing 70% of the work and the ADD will just be doing 30% that's just how it is. If it is then fuck that I'm done I hate this. I wish I was born here had the right to work to make money for my son. I wish I didn't have to worry about getting kicked out and finding a place to live. It's so much all together I can't even describe it we'll here.

1046,Advise please parents,"
My husband and I are parents to two wonderfully active babies. We both work full time. On a good night our babies wake up 2-4 times. Between work and sleepless nights, we are exhausted to say the least. 
My question is about sex. In my opinion, since becoming parents, our sex life - despite our exhaustion - hasn’t suffered a lot. We have sex 1-2 times a week (compared to 3-4 times before having our babies). 
For the last 6 months or so, i have noticed a change in my husband’s libido. Every free moment we get outside of the kids, he wants us to catch up on sex and gets very disappointed when I let him down. He is very grabby, keeps shoving his hands down my pants, sometimes in front of our babies. When I come back from work, the first thing he says is ask if we could do a quickie. Or after tending to the babies at 2 am, when I return to bed, he asks if I want to bang! I can’t even shower in peace. I want to catch up on things like shower in peace; or clean or talk or just sit with a cup of coffee, and hate saying no to him several times in a day. 

Thing is he is not interested in talking about his day and keeps giving me short curt answers. He is not interested in spending time during weekends (for the most part he is quietly sitting on the couch browsing his phone, or catching up with his friends); and he keeps inviting other couples for dinner but doesn’t want to do a solo date night, so I feel disconnected from him. 

I am hoping to get a feedback from parents that went through similar experience. I miss my husband but I don’t want to bang all the time. ... When I tried to talk to him, but it didn’t achieve much.Am I reading too much into this? Is this a red flag? Can u advise something...Thanks.",beyondthebump

By feeling, I mean my pelvic area aches and hurts almost 24/7, I'm leaking huge amounts of discharge and yet suffering from dryness, my boobs hurts like a deep sharp burning pain sometimes, my hips are widening again so that hurts, my butt and thighs are slowly getting back to their larger size, and I feel moody. On top of all this, headaches, extra tiredness (sleeping even more than just from breastfeeding). I would think something is wrong with me, but I have been through this with my firstborn.

My doctor gave me an x-ray for the terrible stomach pains (made better by a heating pad sometimes) just in case, but she thinks it's my cycle returning with rage. Probably is. All she found was ""constipation"" (sometimes I don't poop until late afternoon, though it's not bothersome).

This time is certainly worse, but my period has been gone a little longer. Some days, I can hardly do anything and every movement makes me feel like crying, not just from the constant pain, but from the frustration.

I've googled and find anything on this. It literally feels like puberty did for me, maybe slightly less bad in some ways (like breasts). I'm going from not really reproductive (yes, I know I can still get pregnant, I'm careful) to boom let's make some babies...or else.

Tldr: Body feels likes it's going through puberty 1 year postbirth. Did the same with my firstborn and I got my period at 11 months postpartum. I can't find anything on it. It seems it's not talked about.

Due to my partner working away during the week, I moved in with my mum so she can help out with the baby from time to time.

1051,ON THE VERGE OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN,"Hello Reddit,

I don't know where to start. I'm a single mother who exclusively pumps to feed her almost now 4 month old son. I have a low supply due to having no time to prepare food/ eat, so I'm often running between the kitchen trying to eat whatever I can find, while desperately trying to entertain baby so I can buy some more time to squeeze a few drops to feed and settle him. I am exhausted. I have no support. Baby won't tolerate formula - have tried 5 different ones of the best available and he always ends up violently ill. Baby still hasn't settled in a night routine and wakes every 2 hours to feed, short naps of about 30mins throughout the day, just enough for me to do a mediocre pump and clean some bottles for the next session.

My fiancee and I were together and living together till a couple of months in baby was born. I realized he wasn't the one for me as I got 'too much' for him when I tried to communicate I was drowning. He kept reassuring me and telling me I had it and while I know I'm doing a great job for baby, I was trying to tell him I am neglected myself and going down hill. I needed more support. I couldn't communicate that more clearly and he just became more and more moody towards me for 'complaining' and 'how do other mothers manage it all' when all I needed was a hand and some sleep. I stopped caring about him not caring for me or touching me.

I am so lonely, sleep deprived, and starving most times, it's gotten to the point I am falling asleep standing up with baby in my arms and waking up suddenly, jerking my arms and scaring him, not knowing what year it is or where I am. I am hearing voices and my head feels like it's going to split open. Now that we are apart, once again I tried to communicate I am worried for baby as I am not in good mental or physical health with no support as I care and raise baby and he palmed me off again, acting like I am over exaggerating.

 I feel like I am on the verge of a mental breakdown. It's gotten to the point where I am hearing voices and seeing things out of the corner of my eye and I am not even thinking about myself, I am afraid soon I will be too sick to take care of my baby. Between pumping for 6 hours every day, cleaning bottles 10 times a day, feeding/ playing/ settling baby, and waking up every 2 hours throughout the night (I have been running on a collective of 3 hours broken sleep every night), I don't leave the house anymore. I am scared and I need some help but I do not know where to go or who to turn to as everyone around me seems to palm me off with doing a great job, keep going. I am so heartbroken that the person I thought cared about me does not see or care that I am falling apart.",beyondthebump

He nibbles and like licks my nipple and opens his mouth wide and loses interest.  Sometimes giggles on the boob or babbles. He usually eats till sleepy but today is energized after. He was leeching my face at one point so we tried to nurse again but he just kinda nibbled for 10 minutes. Not really hearing him drink like I usually do  He's only napped for 20 minutes today in the stroller. Worried he's not getting enough milk and confused. Is this self weaning? Would love anyone's input if they experienced. He's overall not that unhappy, little cranky here and there from no sleep but overall he's doing way better than I expected. Thanks",beyondthebump
1055,7mo not pooped for 3 days,"My 7 month old daughter has not pooped for 3 days. She is breastfed and started a few solids last month. She doesn't seem fussy or uncomfortable in any way. Google search says this is ok, but it is so unusual for her. She usually has 1-2 poops a day. 

Is this really normal? Is there something I should be doing?",beyondthebump
1056,Has anyone had hair loss while weaning/stopping breastfeeding?,"I've been having TONS of hairloss lately and the only thing I've changed is that I only breastfeed once or twice a day now instead of the four times a day I used to. I know hair loss can be caused by hormone changes and stopping breastfeeding causes hormone changes. It's just a lot haha. Like so many clumps fall out when I'm showering. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem? Is there any way to fix this? I'm scared to even wash my hair or brush it or anything. Also, maybe if I stop breastfeeding altogether my hormones will go back to normal faster? I really don't want to stop completely",beyondthebump
1057,Can I brag for a minute?,"My baby is obviously not a genius, at least I wouldn't know but she is 15 months old.

She does not walk but she speaks. The doctor says that baby by 18 months should know 20 words. I told her my baby knows 30-40 words. I've stopped keeping score.

I don't know if reading to her is what happened. I don't know what to tell anyone who asks me how. When I felt she was old enough I brought books and read to her at least once a day (usually more) and she loved it.

Shes curious and always pointed at things and I'd tell her what it was repeatingly.

She's been sleeping alone and well in her own room since 7 months. And sleeps when I put her down awake by 11 months. And rarely since she's woken up unexpectly in the middle of the night. (this didn't come naturally I had to work on this but I did not sleep train)

Baby eats almost anything so long as she's eating some of the food herself. So she likes fruits, when I give her oatmeal ill feed her the oatmeal but she'll have the fruits herself by hand... Etc

Otherwise any non-utensils possible food she'll eat on her own.

Most of the time too she does number two on the toliet. I've been trying to get her to get used to potty from a young age so it comes easier when she's older. And I'd say 8/10 times she does number 2. 
I ask her if she needs the bathroom and she knows the word bathroom and if she needs to go she says it back. If not then she doesn't. 

I don't ""brag"" normally to anyone. My sister, mom, friends. I don't like to, and I believe in the evil eye. But today she hit fifteen months and I'm so proud of how far she's come and wanted to share that with people.",beyondthebump
1058,Tantrums at 8 months normal?,"My baby is about 8 months adjusted/10 months actual. She started to get really upset when we take away items she is interested in or if we stop an activity she is enjoying (bouncing her up to see herself in a mirror, etc.) Is this a typical behavior/part or some babies’ personalities?  I understand kids will boundary test but I thought this was more of a toddler behavior. 

Also, my understanding is the best way to handle it is to take away things when appropriate and comfort her. I try to swap for another item but that only works sometimes. I haven’t done much research on how to handle this behavior because I thought “tantrums” occur during the toddler stage. I believe in gentle/responsive parenting. So any tips are appreciated.

1059,I always thought that my son's wellbeing would come before my own...,"It's easy to laugh about this now knowing that our son is totally fine.

After our son's bath last night, I loaded him up in my left arm and his blankets in my right. The walk down our wooden stairs went smoothly. It wasn't until we reached the bottom and I went to step over the baby gate that things turned for the worst.

The moment my left foot stepped on the towel covering our bottom step on the other side (WHY?!) I knew we were doomed. My foot slipped and I took the top of the baby gate straight to my lady parts, all 180 pounds of us straight onto the bar. I immediately cried out as the gate popped off its supports and we fell to the floor. 

No matter how I replay it in mind, there was no way I was sparing our 2 year old with one arm around his butt. My husband, who coming down behind us and had no hope of stopping the action, informed me that in my scrunched-face agony our son landed face first on the floor.

I'm happy to report that he is absolutely okay and only began to cry when he saw me sobbing on the floor holding my bits. 

""Mommy!"" He cried. 

""Mommy's okay, she just hurt her peeps."" replied my husband between stifled laughs.

""Kiss better?"" our son replied.

""We can't kiss that owie."" my husband informed him, fully laughing now.

1060,Bedtime meltdowns Every. Single. Night,"My kiddo is 19 months old. Yes toddler life has been pretty hard. I'm 39 and exhausted. The biggest issue we have that is sucking the life out of my soul is bedtime. We did some gentle sleep training when he was much younger but it doesn't always stick during leaps and regressions. Leap 10 sucked and then he went back to normal. He FINALLY switched to one nap at 18 months. About a week later all hell broke loose. The night wakings, then the early morning wakings. Weird nap stuff. That all calmed down and he can make it through the night. Naps are less dramatic. But bedtime. Bedtime is the worst hell of my life. We start with brushing teeth... I brush and he gets to watch one cocomelon song while I do it. Then he finishes brushing himself. We do bath, we do pajamas, we do sleep sack, then books. Well we USED to do books. He protests the sleep sack initially... But it gets really bad when we get to the books. He tries to keep switching books and then he just starts arching his back, having a tantrum, and wanting to get down. So then we just have to put him in the crib before finishing the books where he proceeds to scream and cry until someone goes in the room and sits next to the crib. He then cries some, rolls around, stands up and throws stuffed animals out, sings, etc. He finally passes out about an hour later. We've tried all sorts of wake windows and every change anyone has ever suggested. The only thing we haven't done is let him scream and cry until he barfs. Has anyone been through this and it passes eventually? We've had this happen before and it ended within a few weeks. It's been 5 and he's doing the same thing at nap time sometimes and bedtime every night with no good nights sprinkled in at all.",beyondthebump

1066,Nursery bed recommendations needed,"We gave up our guest room during the pandemic to make home offices and a nursery. We’ve been taking shifts with the baby to make sure everyone gets a good chunk of deep sleep, and I’ve been sleeping on our living room couch for my shift. We’d like to add back in a twin sized bed to the nursery so I can get off the couch. The nursery is currently a combo of my old office setup and a nursery so it’s short on space, but we think we can make it work. Does anyone have any furniture recommendations or alternative suggestions?

This is what we’re looking for in a nursery bed:

Must haves:

\-Twin sized bed (or equivalent)

\-Something baby can use as a future bed, ideally straight from his mini crib (\~18 months?)

\-Something my husband and I can use (5’2” &amp; 6’) to sleep in shifts with him in the nursery (probably mostly me since my husband tends to stay awake for his shift)

Nice to haves:

\-Extends with trundle for temporary additional sleep space for when guests visit

\-Comfortable for reading bedtime stories

1067,Can we talk about all the STUFF that comes with having a kid?,"I think generationally, and socially, a lot of us as parents have more physical objects than our parents or grandparents had. Because of capitalism, we can buy a lot of stuff very cheaply, and by necessity of having a child, a lot of us end up with more than we need. At the same time, there's a cultural shift towards minimalism, or at least, thoughtful consumerism. I think this is a sensitive topic, because many loved ones want to bestow upon our children gifts to show their love, but it can be hard to express that all this extra stuff doesn't always add value to our lives, it actually can have the opposite effect (cue to overflowing toybox that child is disinterested in) and requires our time and energy to manage on a regular basis. 


How are you managing this in your family's life? Do you get rid of things before they even come into your home? Do you declutter with your child regularly? Or do you firmly tell friends and family not to buy your little one gifts? Or do you accept any and all items as an expression of kindness? 

No judgment regardless of what you have decided on, I'm honestly just curious how others view this topic and how they've chosen to manage it.",beyondthebump

But we haven't taken any real steps towards trying yet (e.g. getting my IUD removed). Whenever I start thinking about having a kid I sort of start spiraling out thinking about:  ""What if our kid has severe health issues I'm not equipped to handle? What am I going to do when I'm sick and I need to take care of them? What I am going to do when they're a teenager? I can't handle a rebellious teen. What if I spoil my kid and they turn out entitled? What if I'm too tough on them and they have to go to therapy for my bad parenting? What if ... etc."" Basically I get overwhelmed with all the things that could go wrong and I could do wrong and feel like I will simultaneously be dealing with all the issues of having a baby/kid/teen. My parents say to just focus on getting pregnant and dealing with that and not to worry about the next steps. I know logically I won't be the same person I am now and will have more experience for every stage my kid is in, but I just get overwhelmed.

1075,One and done?,"Is anyone here one and done? How did you make that choice? What factors went into it? 

My husband and I used to say we would try for one of each. A girl and a boy. If we had two boys or two girls, we would try again but definitely stop at 3. Then we had our first and the one thing that is nonnegotiable is that I’m NOT having 3. No matter what. I’m not having 3. But I’ve started thinking that I don’t even know if I want one more. 

My pregnancy with my now 6 month old was a nightmare. We got pregnant on the first try which was great but I had HG and lost quite a bit of weight, ended up in the hospital on fluids. Was highly medicated to be able to just drink water. I couldn’t do much of anything. I couldn’t hardly take care of myself. Then I got gestational diabetes that we tried hard to control with diet and couldn’t so I had to use insulin. Then I developed high blood pressure, had a horrible time with it, ended up in the hospital with it once before being induced at 36 weeks. My labor and delivery were amazing. But my baby had low blood sugar and extremely high bilirubin levels. Feeding was stressful and required so many blood sugar checks that her heels were bruised constantly. She was in a biliblanket for 16 hours and I was only allowed to take her out for long enough to change her diaper. I had to feed her wrapped in it. I couldn’t hold my baby. We were in the hospital for 5 days with them constantly threatening to take her to the NICU. 

Her newborn days sucked. She had horrible, projectile reflux. She was terrible at sleeping. I have PPD and PPA bad and was extremely miserable in the early days. I’m much better now after speaking to my doctor and getting assistance but looking back on it is terrible. My husband and I didn’t like each other for like the first 5 months of her life. Yes, she was adorable and amazing. I loved her so much and I bonded with her almost instantly, but I did not enjoy having a tiny baby. Only recently have I started to feel like myself and like I’m actually having fun with her instead of just surviving. I haven’t felt like myself since before I got pregnant.

Everyone keeps bugging me about when I’m going to have another. IF I have another, I don’t want a large age gap. I want to take a “get it over with” approach to pregnancy and the newborn phase. We’re talking two years age gap, which would put me at getting pregnant next year sometime. That sounds like a NIGHTMARE. But having an older child and having to force the older child through horrible nights with a screaming baby and having to stay home for naps and have no fun sounds horrible, too. Forcing my current baby through a mom who can’t hardly function due to sickness, no matter how old she is at the time, makes me feel bad. 

It really wasn’t a question of whether or not we would have another until I was talking to someone about how everyone is bugging me about when we plan to have another and the person I was talking to said “if you even have another. Having an only child is a valid choice, too.”

And I was like is it?!?! Can I do that?!?! And I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since. I don’t know how to bring it up to my husband but the more I thinking about it the more it feels better than having another baby.",beyondthebump

They do have a 30 min drive to us. They didn't say anything in person and I assumed they knew that drop off literally meant dropping things off. They then proceeded to list off things they did for is as a good old guilt trip. Usually they are pretty good, but it seems they don't want to do things ""for free"" but always feel as they are owed. 

At this point I don't feel like having them help us or anything because they'll just use it to guilt trip when they don't get what they want.

1091,Finnish baby box and new CPSC (US) ban,"Hi everyone! My first baby is due soon and I was so excited to get a FinnBin that we planned to use for naps in the living room. Baby boxes have been in use in Finland and other parts of the world for decades and it seemed like a place I could put down the baby and feel safe that they were safe if I ran to the bathroom or took a nap on the couch next to the box on the floor. It is a bare mattress with a tight-fitting sheet inside a box, basically. 

Well I’m so sad to just realize the new CPSC rulemaking that is set to ban these next summer, though there is a comment period first. My husband and I are reading through the report and incident data to try to understand the reasoning. This mostly got attention for its ban on inclined sleeping products. For flat sleepers including the boxes, none of the incidents involved boxes from what I could tell. They seemed to mostly be situations where a flat sleeper was placed on top of an adult bed or inside a playard, etc, and where the sides were soft. The issue seems to be that these boxes don’t have legs or a stand so that is deemed as risky is say a toddler pushed it or something, but we have no pets and this is our first child. 

I have no interest at all in flouting safety regulations but I am super frustrated because it seemed like I understood safe sleep recommendations, only to wind up with an inexpensive product that seemed so safe but I guess we can’t use? Ugh. Does anyone have any wisdom here? The boxes are such a small part of the US market and Finland has been giving them out for 80 years!

I've posited similar questions before about who was and wasn't okay to be around our newborn son. He's a little over 4 months old (was a preemie). 

When it seemed as though most people we knew were vaccinated and the Delta variant wasn't much of a concern... We (along with many other new mom Redditors) maintained the rule that only fully vaccinated close friends and family were allowed to be near and hold the baby (after he was +2 mos. old).

However, now with the Delta variant around, and with all of the new, emerging information about how transmissible it is, how it can infect and break through to fully vaccinated individuals... Should we be reconsidering our policy?

Are you? Is it no longer safe for fully vaccinated people to be around a newborn?

What are your thoughts and/or what are you doing re: Delta?",beyondthebump

1106,Birth Control Woes,"TL;DR Upcoming postpartum appointment and OB needs to know what BC I want to go on. Have been on the pill before and also the IUD Mirena. I can’t decide which one. Have had some issues with both. (Issues below) 

—

I am torn on what birth control to go back on. I’ve been on the pill - Sprintec (since I was 17 - 27 now) and also did the IUD Mirena from 2016-2019. 

I’ve had pros and cons to both. The reason I got Mirena removed was because I was having inconsistent spotting and some bleeding during sex. 

I then went back on the pill but the pill kills my sex drive and I then again have bled during sex due to vaginal dryness. 

SO I am conflicted but also want to know if anyone has any experience with the Kyleena  IUD? Maybe a different IUD brand won’t cause inconsistent spotting? (PS no interest in copper IUD) 

The IUD appeals to me because it’s a pill I don’t have to take everyday (or remember especially with a newborn) but I’m scared to possibly deal with the inconsistent spotting again - wondering if my body will act differently since I gave birth?

She would wake every 30 minutes to feed and sometimes shed be so uncomfortable she wouldn't go back to sleep for an hour or so before waking up AGAIN. It was so bad that unless we gave her baby Motrin, we straight up did not get sleep.

  


Then, down from the heavens, came the Hyland's Nighttime Teething Tablets. I was at my wits end, and I normally don't buy into the homeopathic remedy vibe, but I was willing to try anything but more ibuprofen for my poor baby's system. I also was super reluctant because I had tried a similar teething tablet to no avail as well as the heavily recommended Boiron Camila doses which didn't do much either.

  


But oh, my god...SHE SLEPT 4 HOURS STRAIGHT! ONLY ONE ""NIGHT"" WAKING! Her sleep has NEVER been this good and she is comfortable and happy upon her quick feed and right back to sleep.

  


I know all babies are different, and homeopathic remedies seem to be very word of mouth, but my lord, my baby went from ibuprofen which kept her sleeping about 2 to 2.5 hours at a time to chamomile and arnica for 4 hour stretches.

1121,First Day of Daycare + Anti-Vax Teachers?,"As a new FTM, I guess I'm looking for a little advice.

Today was our 12-week-old's first day at daycare. We just took him for 3 hours as a trial run.

In our area, there aren't a lot of good daycares, and the few that exist have long waitlists. We were super fortunate to get into our first choice! When we toured months ago, I asked if all the staff were vaccinated. The Director said no, not yet. Which was weird, but it was months ago. (I myself wasn't fully vaccinated at the time, so I didn't judge too hard.)

Today when we dropped the baby off, I asked again. The Director said that they were proud to say 96% of their employees are vaccinated. So wanting a little clarity, I said ""Everyone in the Infant Room is, right?""
She said ""A couple of the teachers in the Infant Room are not. But that's why we all wear masks.""

Ummm... a couple?? There are 4 teachers in the Infant Room! So at least 50% of the people who will be giving a bottle, soothing, and diaper changing my kid have decided not to get the vaccine?

My husband and I were both pretty stunned in the moment. We just nodded and said ""Okay"" and continued on with getting the kiddo set up for the day. We went into the Infant Room and the first thing I see, one of the 4 teachers is walking around with her mask pulled down below her nose. I figured maybe it was just a momentary thing. But when we went back a few hours later for pickup, that same teacher still had her mask pulled down.

I know kids aren't as susceptible as adults to the Delta Variant. I know there are a million reasons not to worry -- this daycare seems fine otherwise. We have friends with a toddler there and they love it. 

But I just can't stop thinking, given what I've seen today, these teachers must not take Covid or the health of these infants seriously. 

So what does everyone think? I know a lot of you have kids in various daycares all around the globe, so I guess I just want perspective. Am I just a nervous mom overthinking the first day of daycare? Or would this be enough to make you pull your kid out, even if you had no childcare alternative? How would you handle it?",beyondthebump

It freaked me out because I have never seen that before. My ob did a finger exam and said it felt lax which is from birth but that nothing was falling when I coughed. She referred me to pelvic pt who also said I just needed to do kegels at home but there was no prolapse. 

I am so confused because sometimes when I look I don’t see it but if I check later in the day I can see it. I noticed too that sometimes I get pelvic pressure and I also had horrible pelvic pain during my pregnancy. Should I get a second opinion? I find it weird that both doctors said no prolapse but then I can see it. I am grieving the loss of my daughter and also dealing with this. 

I am worried that it’ll affect future pregnancies and I also want to workout and lose pregnancy weight but I am scared to because I don’t want to cause anything or make the pelvic issue worse. I am also afraid to use tampons because of it. Sorry to ramble but does anyone has ever any insight on this or any experience? I was 5 months postpartum as of yesterday. Thank you 😊",beyondthebump
1148,Considering taking 13 week old to the beach this weekend - tips?,"Well, he'll be 14 weeks by the weekend. Anyways, we just moved into a new house which is right across the street from a quiet beach. I'm thinking of taking LO on Saturday, though I'm not sure yet. If it's too hot outside I most certainly won't be taking him. What has been your experience with taking a baby this age to the beach? Fortunately, it's a 1 minute drive from our house, so if he starts to fuss or something else goes wrong, it'll be a quick trip home. 

What are some beach essentials for a baby? He has a rash guard swimsuit, though I don't plan on taking him into the water.",beyondthebump
1149,MIL Issues,"I'll preface this by saying that I love my mother-in-law. We get along really well and always have. We are extremely fortunate that she is our nanny/babysitter. She volunteered to do this for all her grandkids and said that she understood we can't pay her a lot and she wasn't expecting anything. We worked it out that we could afford to pay her $50 a week. She comes usually between 3-5 days a week depending on our work schedules and is here from 6:30 to 3:30. 

Well, lately she's had to come a lot less because of my schedule (I was on maternity leave) and I feel like she's starting to lose her sense of responsibility now that she's back to her normal schedule. She shows up really late all the time- like two hours late sometimes- and is always trying to leave early. When she is here, she falls asleep on the couch with my 2 month old while my 2 year old just sits in front of the TV or plays with my MIL's cell phone. 

One day I caught her looking at nanny job postings on Craigslist and she even was talking about how much some of them paid. To me. While she was watching my kids. It rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel like she thinks we don't pay her enough. 

I'm in a weird position because I want to talk to her like someone I've hired but she's also my MIL so I don't know how to approach any of this. I've asked my husband to talk to her several times and he never does.

Anyway, any tips? Thanks in advance.",beyondthebump

I tell her again, and she does the same thing. She thinks it’s a game and it goes on forever. If I tell her not to touch something, she will cry for a little and go for it again. Same thing with hitting. I don’t want to take my frustration out on her, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I am trying to break the cycle of yelling and hitting.

1157,NICU mom and upcoming wedding,"Hi all,

I'm located in the Northeast where our vaccination rates are pretty high. I am a bridesmaid in a wedding on 8/12 but the county where the wedding is held has a low vaccination rate. The bride is not requiring vaccines and has said that ""the onus is on the guest and if they get sick that's on them"" (I'm not sure that's how that works, but okay) nor do guests need to show a negative covid test result. My husband and I are fully vaccinated, in fact, I got the Pfizer vaccines when I was pregnant and I'm breastfeeding my 10-week old son but the pediatrician said that there isn't a foolproof way yet to check if the baby has antibodies, but there's a strong likelihood he does. I have no idea if the majority of her guests will be vaccinated and she has complained about vaccine-hesitant relatives that will most likely be there. There will be over 100 guests and the reception is indoors.   


What is making me the most nervous is that my son was in the NICU for 9 days due to respiratory distress after he was born. He's thriving and is the healthiest little chunk there is, but my gut is telling me to back out of the wedding in some capacity due to the delta variant. I was considering doing the ceremony (which is outdoors) and not staying for the reception, but at any point I'm indoors I'll wear my mask.

1162,Needing some serious help with 2.5 year old,"We are getting desperate. My 2.5 year old recently (a couple months ago now) climbing out of his crib consistently, even when wearing a sleep sack. So, even thoughi really didn't think he was ready for it, we felt we had no option but to switch him to a toddler bed. 

Since then, life has been a nightmare. He will not sleep or stay in bed. We do our bedtime routine, put him down I usually scratch his back/sing for a few minutes, sometimes he falls asleep, sometimes not.  If not, he will get up a few times, we'll walk him back a million times, eventually he gets the drift and goes to sleep. Not ideal but it's fine. 

The problem starts around 1am when he decides it should be morning time. He will not go back to sleep. He opens his door, stands at the gate, and yells for us. (I have two other kids, so letting him just stand there screaming isn't a great option). We go in, he tries a litany of excuses which we generally ignore unless legit (diaper change, etc).  Then we start the walk back to bed process again. Except it can go on for 1-2 hrs EVERY NIGHT.  Sometimes more than once. 

He has an ok to wake clock.... doesn't make a difference We've tried everything... sleeping in there with him (in the beginning... it started to backfire so stopped). Letting him cry for awhile (turns into banging as loudly as possible on the door and screaming, or throwing anything not bolted down in his room. We've removed almost everything at this point). We've given kiddie melatonin, but it only works for part of the night. We've tried going down early bc he's massively over tired and is refusing naps too, but he just wakes up even earlier. 

He's my second of three kids so it's not like I've not dealt with sleep stuff before, but this kid is killing us slowly and I don't know what to do.

1169,Advice in convincing wife to visit counselling/psychologist for post-partum depression,"We're first time parents to a 9wk old boy, perfectly healthy but the first 2-5 weeks were stricken with colic. My wife is having problems with sleep deprivation and is exhausted to the bone. She's always had issues with anxiety but having depression during pregnancy and taking care of a baby without the support of our parents (COVID prevents international travel), she is having emotional break-downs almost weekly (hysterical crying/laughing, hitting herself, verbally abusive). My mom will be able to visit in 1 month to help (getting her 2nd COVID shot soon) and her parents are in China, unable to get a VISA to visit due to the corona. Until then, we are on our own.

She says everything will be fine if she could get help taking care of the baby and sleep (I've already taken 5 weeks paternal leave but have to be back at work). She resents me for suggesting she's crazy and needs to be ""cured"".  She says she needs sleep and does not have time to visit the psychologist her gyno recommended. She prioritizes visiting her Kinesiologist to get her body back to shape over the psychologist...

I've been telling her she needs mental health counselling to reduce her anxiety and process her trauma. I admit she primarily needs quality sleep, but her anxiety affects her sleep quality. She stayed up after the 4am feed thinking about all the ways I take advantage of her because I (tired) slept through the 4am feed and let her breastfeed the baby by herself. She's not crazy, she's been through a traumatic experience, even our midwife told me to visit a psychologist asap to prevent severe PPD.

This is also a cultural challenge. She's Chinese and asian culture doesn't look kindly to people who visit therapists, there's a stigma to mental health.

Hi , 

FTM here , I have a 5 year old baby girl and I’m BF but lately I took the Covid shot and she usually is BF for 20-30  mins but after the shot I observed she’s doing it only around 15 mins . This has raised a few questions in my mind :

1) Does the vaccine in anyway change the way the milk tastes or anything else is affected regarding BF ?

2) I have very sore breasts and since she’s not latching that easily and frequently can I start pumping to relive that soreness and pain or is there any other way to deal with the soreness and pain ?

3) is there a way/what to do to manage the supply and also ensure that she is getting enough ? P.S. she’s getting the required number of dirty diapers as suggested

1181,5.5 MO absolutely HATES tummy time,"My LO is a drama queen who starts grunting within seconds of being placed on her tummy. 2 min in she is screaming/ growling at me to pick her up. Anger does not encourage her to explore/ turn over. Was anyone else in this position? How did your LO learn to roll over? 

She has been doing this since birth. We do 2-3 times per day of TT attempts as I want to form pleasant memories together in lieu of traumatizing ones. None of the usual advice for extending TT worked (propped on a small pillow, propped on my feeding pillow to be taller, mirrors, getting on her eye level, crossing leg and having her follow a toy slightly out of reach…). Since becoming fascinated with her feet, she does a beautiful job of rolling to her side and back, but never all the way over. 

For context, my LO insisted on being carried all the time and wouldn’t allow me to ever sit down / lay her down until about 2 weeks ago (straightening legs, arching back, screaming if I don’t react to her cues). For this reason TT on our chest has not been helpful either. She’d start grunting few seconds in and eventually demand a change. She built up next strength very early and has somehow kept up with her milestones so I have not been too concerned up until now.

Well, turns out one of my in laws just tested positive, and that person was visiting indoors with my MIL for a while during a contagious period.

And now their tune has totally changed.

 ""Oh, you really can't put blame on anyone for this.""

 ""It's really unfortunate but no one's fault really"" 

So yea. A reminder that if you or your little one DOES get covid, the people who have been putting pressure on you to stop social distancing will not, like, take responsibility or apologize. Because your health and your baby's health is your responsibility. They're not paying for it, you are.

That I'm a good mom, but he doesn't know if his feelings for me are the same. He looked for support elsewhere, and now I feel like my whole life is falling apart. 

What could I have done differently? I know I was a shitty wife. I was irritable, and cold, but looking back I don't know what I could have changed. I was so tried, I was so depressed, and I just wanted to be a good mom. I don't know how to save my marriage now. I feel so guilty and terrible for how I treated him and how he must have felt.

This should be for the first few months while her circadian rhythms are all wonky. Once she’s sleeping through the night we will try to be more normal. 

We have separate bedrooms for this to work, and we’re hoping to split our days and be able to spend some time as a family in the evening before I sleep/he works. I am planning to breast feed and pump, although I am not ruling out supplementing with formula if necessary.

At first she was a happy spitter. Then around 9 weeks she'd arch , wail, spit up 4 times with EVERY feed. The whole time she was gaining weight so well (30-50g/d) and output was more than adequate so neither my midwife, GP or LC wants to start meds.  We sae an LC twice who gave some minor tweaks, although I was mostly on the right track (I'm an LDR RN). We were on probiotics since week 2. I hold her upright for 30 min after feeds. Diaper and clothes are not too tight. We switched to a convertible car seat since she hated and spat up so much in the bucket one. My supply has gone down (but still enoug) and is no li ger fast. I cut out dairy and coffee and am gluten free 90% of the time. Apparently I'm doing all the right things but she's still spits up 4 times after every feed an cant tolerate being in her back or tummy for more than 5-10min even through she loves playing in her gym as she'll cry and spit up.

1207,I can’t sleep because I went against my instincts a few weeks ago.,"This will be a long one but I need to vent. 

My son is 5 months old. Ever since he was born my anxiety has been through the roof. As all of you know, I love him so much it hurts and I have zero interest in being away from him. I pick him up, comfort and hug him as soon as he shows any signs of discomfort. I answer to his every need without hesitation, and he rarely cries or screams because I feel like he can quickly get satisfied by being picked up by either me or his dad. 

This is irritating the shit out of my parents. Every time I go with my instinct and comfort my son when he’s sad or uncomfortable they will sigh, roll their eyes and tell me I am spoiling him. That he has learned how to manipulate me. I will always shrug or laugh it off. I just do not believe in letting a little baby cry it out or make them go through unnecessary stress just to “teach them how to be independent”. 

But then my birthday happened. Me, baby, boyfriend, my parents and my brother were having dinner in this outdoor seating restaurant next to a big square. As the food came my baby became fussy and obviously tired so I started tying my sling so he can sleep on me while we all enjoy our meal together. I know him and I know what works for his different moods. Before I know it my parents jumps up and insists my dad take him in the stroller around the square. As everyone starts moving around the chairs to get the stroller out my babe starts full on crying. I try to tell them it will not work as he rarely sleeps in the stroller. But before I know it my dad is walking away with my baby crying even louder. I stand up to go after them but my mom starts pulling my dress telling me to sit down and to eat my food. I of course cannot do this. She says “I promise you, just give them 3 minutes. He need to learn to fall asleep without you.” I almost started crying and felt completely run over by my parents. Two minutes pass and I still hear my baby crying while my dad walk around the square. Then I say that it will be enough, run over to them and my baby immediately stops crying as he sees me. I put him in the sling and he falls asleep within a minute. My dad says that he is manipulative. I tell both my parents off.

Later that night my mom rips my baby from my arms again after I breastfed “so that you can eat”. Like I can eat a fucking slice of watermelon with one hand. My baby takes one extremely sad look at me and starts crying again. My mom gets shocked by this. I take him back and tell them they are no longer going to take my baby from me without my permission. I haven’t met them since.

I keep repeating the evening in my mind and just hating that I didn’t immediately stand my ground, went against my gut and let my parents run all over me. I know he wasn’t hurt by it, but I can’t get over the feeling of failing my son. Please tell me I’m overreacting and that I don’t need to worry about it.

1208,Appreciate you all / See you around!,"This subreddit has been wonderful for so, so much. My little one is 10 months old now, and thanks to having almost no irl support (thanks, Covid), I probably wouldn’t have made it this far without such a supportive community to turn to during both the good and bad times! This group is fantastic for advice, for venting, for sharing triumphs and memes, everything!!

But alas, all good things must come to an end. My LO has been getting fussier and fussier as time goes on, and I thought it was teething, or growing, or even just an unfortunate but hopefully temporary personality shift. And then, this morning,  my phone died because I forgot to plug it in last night. 

So, it spent all morning charging. She was not fussy ONCE. Had to be a fluke right? Tried it again this afternoon, her fussy peak, and she was. Not. Fussy. Once. She has been playing independently for months now, so I’d browse Reddit or play a phone game for a few minutes at a time. What I was missing was that during her independent play, she looks up at me every minute or so, makes eye contact, smiles (when she gets it), and goes back to playing. 

I feel *terrible*. I know my phone usage has been up but I checked the screen time app today and it’s a disgusting number of hours per day. Honestly just trying to keep off my phone for a single afternoon was a challenge. Every few moments I’d get the urge to pick it up and… I don’t even know what! So, as LO takes her nap, I’m turning my phone into a “dumb phone” with huckleberry and banking only.

1214,Weaning support,"I don’t even know where to start.  

Before my second baby arrived I was very hopeful that I could make breastfeeding happen this time.  Unfortunately, I experienced a lot of the same issues and my baby just won’t transfer enough milk.  So, I’ve been pumping since she was born (triple feeding for the first 4-6 weeks) Over the last month I’ve slowly introduced formula bottles and have dropped pumping sessions.  

I EP’d for my first daughter for ~8 months and I told myself I wouldn’t do that again - I regretted the time spent away from her pumping. 

At my new baby’s 2 month appointment she wasn’t gaining weight well, and that’s when I really gave up hope on making direct breastfeeding work.  If she wasn’t gaining on bottles was it even safe for me to start trying to latch her again?  And that’s where I am now… my baby has reflux and is on medication for it, struggling to stay on her low weight curve.  I go back to work in five days.  I’m down to 2-3 pumps per day and I think I’m feeling the hormonal crash.  

Can someone please tell me it’s okay to keep weaning?  That maybe NOT breastfeeding could actually be the best thing for me and baby?",beyondthebump

1216,Feel like having a baby was a huge mistake,"I'm her father, and no I didn't have to push out the baby or carry her for 9 months, but I don't think I've ever been more sad, exhausted, or depressed over a decision my whole life.

 Prior to the baby, I had lots of hobbies, travelled the world, had a thriving loving relationship with my wife and more. I built things, flew drones, worked on cars, and loved my wallstreet job. But it all feels like that's gone.

I have a 9 week old, and it is has been ruff. Nobody can really explain how demanding and exhausting and selfless you have to be to raise a child. I am just grabbing at any moments of peace, and when she sleeps, I just wanna stay up and have a chance to be me, but I'm so tired that I can't even enjoy those moments. I find myself wanting to pack up and just disappear. 

I find myself not even wanting to wake up, because I know what the day requires. When does it get better? When will I get 7-9 hours straight of sleep every night again? When will I get a chance to live again? I don't get time with my wife... Love life is non-existent. I don't get to travel or do any hobbies I had. I work 9-10 hours a day, and I'm exhausted even before the day starts. 

I feel so guilty because she's beautiful, and it isn't her fault, but if I could go back and undo this decision I would. I know not all experiences are the same, but I'm hoping someone has a positive word or glimmer of hope for me. I hope I didn't ruin my life. 😞😞

1220,In-laws woke up baby from nap,"
I’m just so frustrated today. Got up at 6 am with the baby and he didn’t go down for a nap until almost 10 am. I kid you not he had been asleep for *five* minutes after half an hour of trying to get him down and my in laws just walk in, no knock, nothing. My husband and I were both in our underwear. I don’t really even care about that part, they asked where the baby was and I said he was asleep in his room. Normally they just go in and quietly look at him WELL NOT TODAY. They go in and just start talking to him as loud as humanly possible and wake him up. So I’m furious, but I don’t say anything because we pay them to watch the baby for us while we work during the week so don’t want to upset the amazing help they give us. 

So they leave after like ten minutes at the house, you know, just long enough to wake him up and then split. Ok so no big deal right, he will go back to sleep. WRONG. I have been trying to put this baby back down for a nap since 10 and he won’t sleep. He will be sleeping peacefully in my arms for one minute and then I put him down and he’s awake and screaming. I let him cry it out but he flips over and is wide awake. I’ve done this over and over again for the past three hours. 

So now it’s 1 pm and my husband is “tired” and is taking a nap. So here I am, last day off for me with the grumpiest, teething baby on the planet because of my dumb in laws and a currently unhelpful husband that is probably going to be asleep until 6. Mind you he’s also off for the next three days so not like he can’t take a nap tomorrow. 

I’m just so salty and angry. My god I just want to sleep in until 8 am for the first time in five months. I’m just so done. I’m fantasizing about just plopping the baby on the bed next to my husband and leaving for a couple hours without saying a word.",beyondthebump

1222,*sigh* Why is it so hard to get decent help out of grandmas? My suggestions for post-partum help!," I'm 37 weeks and set to be induced on Wednesday. We also have a 2.5 year old toddler girl who is generally sweet and well-behaved but can still be exhausting because...toddlers. The first time around, we didn't have any visitors or ""helpers"" until my mom came to stay with us when the baby was about 2 months old, but we decided we wanted more help right away this time because we need someone to watch our daughter while we're at the hospital and knew it would be extra hard to handle a newborn with a toddler that also needs care. We asked my MIL to come stay with us starting at 36 weeks because I had my first girl at 36+4, so she's been staying with us for the past week. She is super, super sweet and easy-going and we get along very well but she is also, I think, very passive (which is a trait I also see in my husband). She hasn't really been chipping in to help with our toddler's routine unless we specifically ask her to do something. And she doesn't really take charge of situations and/or isn't present when we really need her. Like, we just went to a store earlier to pick out some frames for baby #2's room and while my husband and I were trying to look at the frames, MIL wandered off to look at some home goods instead of watching our toddler and toddler broke an expensive candle all over the floor. I see plenty of posts on here about very challenging mother and MIL situations and mine is actually pretty easy, so I feel guilty for even being annoyed at this point, but it is SO frustrating to have someone  come stay with you under the guise of ""helping"" and you end up not really feeling like they're helping at all. My husband and I are still handling toddler's laundry, doing most of the cooking, bathing toddler, etc. I had to have a talk with my husband last night to tell him that he needs to boss his mom around a little bit because I don't feel comfortable doing it, but I think she needs explicit, direct instruction on how she can help. And husband needs to stop saying ""Oh, don't worry mom, I'll clean up the dishes."" No! She is here to help US! Let her do it!

 

That's my rant, so now...my suggestions on how to best communicate with your stay-over ""helpers"" if you're planning on having any in the postpartum period:

1. Make a list!! Tape it to the fridge!! What, EXACTLY, do you want your helpers to be responsible for? For me, I do NOT want to be responsible for meal planning or cooking right now, and my husband and I got into a tiff the other night because there was nothing to eat. This was exactly what I would have appreciated help with but my MIL doesn't know what we eat and never really asked how she could help with cooking. Coach your helpers through their responsibilities on the 1st day. If you want them to do meal planning, show them your favorite recipe book and give directions on how to get to the grocery store and order curbside pickup or whatever. If you want them to do laundry, show them where and how you keep all the clothes stored.
2. Be prepared to be direct and over-communicative. If you have someone who will cook and clean and run errands without even needing to be asked, you are GOLDEN! But that kind of helper is rare indeed. And yes, it sucks to have to constantly say ""Could you please empty the dishwasher?"" ""Could you sweep and mop today?"" ""Could you pick up breakfast tomorrow?"" because you're basically taking on household management, even if someone else does the work, but you may need to do this especially in the beginning. A good helper will eventually pick up on what they can do to help WITHOUT needing to be constantly asked. 
3. Get on the same page as your husband. I think, especially with MIL situations, sons can feel like they need to ""take care"" of their mothers as much as their wives, so my husband kept jumping in to cook or clean up the dishes instead of letting his mom do it. And then sometimes he would get frustrated because he was also trying to help get the toddler down to bed later on. I had to explicitly point out to him that THESE were the things his mom should be doing and HE needed to be clear with her too about when we needed help. If your helper is a MIL, you need to talk to your husband in advance about how he can coach his mom through what you need and ask him to take on the responsibility of communicating with her so it's at least one less thing on your plate.

Sound exhausting? Well, yes, it is. I think we would all love someone who just jumps in and knows what to do and how to help, but, like I said, that's going to be a rare situation, which is why so many of us are concerned about who/when/how to have postpartum helpers. And why it often feels easier to just go it alone with you and your husband because helpers can easily feel like more work than it's worth. Anyhow, my MIL leaves tomorrow and my own mother arrives later in the afternoon so it will be a different story then. She will probably drive me more nuts, but I also know her style and know that she is more hands-on and I can feel more comfortable bossing her around. :-p

1227,Back to work and sleep regression.,"Officially at the end of maternity leave and my 3mo seems to be hitting the “four month” sleep regression. We started a trial run of daycare last week (for 3 days).  We will continue to be MWF daycare and I’ll be part time, but man this timing stinks! She was an excellent sleeper until the last few nights and feel like we are in the newborn phase again. 

Already was anxious about going back to a job I don’t love and having to pump in a stressful/busy environment. Now haven’t slept again for three nights. I’m worried we don’t have a solid plan for how to handle the frequent night time wakings (comfort first? Pacifier? always feed? She seems hungry every waking..) and I definitely don’t want to consider any sort of sleep training for a couple of months at least.  I’m also not sure if she is overtired from daycare/us trying to get her to nap in the crib again after basically two months of wearing or holding her. She will go down in her crib for most daytime naps now, but usually just one sleep cycle (~35-40mins). Sigh. This too shall pass…

1228,Pointers on getting 10 wk old baby down for a nap?,"I’m concerned our baby is consistently overtired b/c he’s not getting enough hours of sleep every day. I’m attempting to fix that, but it feels like I’m trying to navigate in the dark and would love some perspective…

I’ve tried a few techniques for putting baby down to nap. 

1) Monitoring his wake windows, watching for sleepy cues, and shift into “sleep mode” (AKA cuddling, swaddling, swaying, pacifier, shushing etc.) once I see those cues. He typically struggles against the swaddle and continues looking around, craning his head to see things, etc., which makes me think he’s not tired at all. Once i get him relatively settled (through lots of cuddling, swaying in the dark, etc.) I put him down for his nap. This approach feels hit or miss because most of the time he is wide awake and spends his first minutes squirming, fussing, etc. Sometimes he falls asleep (mornings are easiest), but esp. as the day wears on, he doesn’t seem to sleep at all — he alternatively closes his eyes, wiggles, and fusses on and off however long we leave him in the crib (usually 45-60 minutes usually before he gets audibly upset). 

2) letting him hang out with us (awake, looking around, etc.) until he gets fussy. I know this means he’s potential overtired but he typically falls asleep much faster and SEEMS to sleep more heavily. Of course sometimes he won’t sleep at all—does the same squirming / fussing thing detailed above. 

3) Our pediatrician recently told us that we need to put baby down to nap based on his wake windows, not sleepy cues, because “sometimes they don’t even have sleepy cues, they’re just tired and not showing it”. This feels maddening to me — have tried it a few times and he always wiggles against the swaddle, looks around, fusses, etc. 


I’m wondering if this approach — putting baby down seemingly wide awake and letting him fuss in the crib until he gets truly upset — is normal? I worry that putting him down too early means he won’t sleep at all, but maybe I’m overthinking it. If I go purely on wake windows, I’m going to have to ignore his physical cues. Wondering if anyone else has taken this approach successfully. 

P.S. In all cases outline above, LO has been fed, burped, and changed. IDK why he fusses—it seems like he just resents being swaddled and wants to keep hanging out or being physically active / mentally stimulated. But I’m guessing that’s wrong…",beyondthebump

1232,Baby currently refusing bassinet,"I feel like the Bernie Sanders meme, ""I am once again asking for your support"" 

Hi again 

My baby just turned 2 months old and is refusing the bassinet. The past 3 nights he's been only wanting to sleep on me throughout the night. I can get him to sleep fine, but everytime it comes to the transfer he wakes right back up. 

Maybe it's the sleeping on his back? When I'm watching him during the day he does nap best on his side or stomach. 

I also thought that maybe the bassinet mattress was too hard? It's very firm, where as the surfaces he sleeps on during the day are softer. 

I read somewhere (and idk if it's true) that by 3 months old babies can develop a preferred preference for sleep. I don't want that to be on me. 

Any sleep advice would be helpful.",beyondthebump

1243,Terrified to do it again.,"I will delete this in a day or two because I feel guilty even saying it out loud but here it goes.

I had my first child at the end of 2019. He’s now a healthy perfect little one and a half year old and I love being his mom. Life is good. That being said, it wasn’t easy getting him here. My husband and I both agree we want a sibling for him but I am really hesitating and finding any reason to wait because of what it means for me and my body. My pregnancy had a lot of complications involving bed rest and long medical leave from work. I basically lived at the hospital for the last couple months because I needed such frequent monitoring to make sure he wasn’t in any distress. And that’s on top of all the typical shitty symptoms like nausea, heart burn, swelling etc. Needless to say I have never been more stressed out in my life but I never dared complain at the time because I was always so scared that at any moment I’d lose my baby so as long as they told me he was still okay then I was grateful and nothing else mattered. I think my husband got a false sense of the level of difficulty it was/is to be pregnant because I was so quiet about the struggles and just powered through. 

And nothing compares to how excruciating I found the labour and the postpartum healing to be. It was of course worth it to have my son and I won’t bother with all the gory details because I’m sure most of you can relate but that was a misery I am not eager to relive. Not to mention while now having two children to care for on top of it all. 

I know each pregnancy is different and it could be better but what if it’s just as bad…or worse? I’m in my thirties now and with all my previous complications I don’t want to add to the potential risks with my age being on the higher end but when I think back on it what I went through it spikes my anxiety and I just don’t know how I’ll get up the willpower to do it all again.

Now if he gets her up in the morning, she says ""No. Mama!"" and will lie back down to make it hard to pick her up. If he tries to put her in the car seat while I'm in the car, she'll scream ""No! Mama!"" and will barrel roll and fight him until I buckle her in. Yesterday, he tried to put her to bed and she cried so hard that she was hiccuping. It took over an hour to calm her down. At the beach, I was playing in the sand with her and he came over to play with us and she just screamed ""No Papa! No Papa!"" until he moved away and then she started playing again. WTF?!?

1251,Do Vacation Spots Matter For The Entire Family Or Just The Kids?,"Hello, I am a FTM about 10 weeks away from having my baby. Me and my SO were talking about the future and fun things to do with our baby and future babies. Vacations came up and I told him that I absolutely do not want to use vacation money or time to go to anything Disney related. (He has known my dislike for Disney since we got together) I'm just not a fan of Disney, not the movies, not any rides (I dont get on any rides anywhere at all) not people in big mascot costumes, not the shopping of their products or anything. It's just not me, I've never been interested not even when I myself was little. 

He tells me that if our kid(s) want to go there that that is where were going. basically weather I like it or not. I'm a bit bummed out because if were having a family vacation I'd like to enjoy the destination as much as everyone else. I figure we would find a spot all of us want to go to and go. He says once we have our little family that it's no longer about me and him and while I agree, I think everyone should be considered for a vacation. Of course I'd enjoy myself at Disney since I'd be with my family but I just thought we could all enjoy the spot. I figure as a child they will pretty much have fun anywhere we take them given it's a new and different place than home. 

Of course I know this is all hypothetical given that it's at least a few years ahead of us but I was wondering when it comes to vacations does what a parent wants from said not matter in terms of where to go or what to do? Is the vacation run by the kids and parents just pay the way? How is it handled for vacation decisions?

MIL: “oh, that’s just wrong.”

And that’s when I crossed the room and said, “you know, we’re working on it (inner thought: ‘btw our baby is 4mo, like chill the f*ck out’) and every baby and every baby-parent relationship is different so if someone needs to cosleep with their kid in order for everyone to get a good nights sleep then that’s what they’re going to do.”

Then MIL’s friend changed her tune VERY quickly and was *almost* apologetic saying, “oh yeah, you can’t judge what other parents are doing…” blah blah blah YOU WERE JUST JUDGING BOTH ME AND YOUR FRIEND LOL

Everyone needs to mind their own business when it comes to parenting or at least have ZERO judgment in regards to how others parent. As long as the kid is loved and taken care of in a way that will help the child grow however they need to to be productive and kind (if able) then who CARES how they slept as an infant/toddler. Anyway, my take away is: (American) boomer generation is judgy af and that’s got to stem from some wonky parenting. Now that’s a judgment I think is warranted.",beyondthebump
1255,PSA! Different brands of bottles have different nipple flow rates! They are not standardized! If your baby is frustrated using a bottle check if you need to move up (or down) a size.,"I've just spent a week with an incredibly fussy and hard to soothe 5 week old. It turns out he was eating less than he needed to - only about 3 ounces at each feed. He'd cry and want to eat every 1 - 2 hours and sleep badly in between feeds. He'd get frustrated while eating and scream at the bottle and fall asleep while eating. He was taking about 30 minutes to do 3 ounces. 

On a whim and out of desperation I decided to move up to level 2 nipples for the Dr. Brown's standard-neck bottle I use. Well he chowed down 3 ounces in 12 minutes which has NEVER happened before and then went on to sleep peacefully for 2 solid hours, which hasn't happened in a week. 

After consulting a friend who is a NICU nurse and feeding consultant (lactation and otherwise) she said that Dr. Brown's nipples are particularly slow and you need to move up a size earlier than most. (Here is an academic article about that if you like that kind of thing). 

This didn't immediately occur to me because it says ""3 months"" for the level 2 nipple. But it's totally changed my baby who is now happy and content after each feed and eating isn't taking him 30-40 frustrated minutes. 

By the way, I exclusively formula feed and I get tons of help from the Fed is Best Infant Infant Feeding Peer to Peer Support Group on Facebook. I highly recommend it :)

1256,Concerned about post adoption problems,"If this doesn't belong here please feel free to delete!

Hi! My best friend and her partner are fostering a newborn baby recently and she has completely changed in every way. Her partner, mother and I are starting to get very worried.

I was curious to find if anyone has ever heard of post adoption mood disorders. I can only find post-adoptive depression studies and articles out there but this isn't depression.

It's a really unhealthy obsession with the baby, she doesn't let anyone else really take care of it at all. She has massive, scary mood swings, is keeping her partner up at night, started lying to me (or flossing over truths) in ways she never has, no longer confides in me, has panic attacks and has begun to have tantrums because she very suddenly wants to carry a child and her partner is terrified of that because of this experience. The idea also terrifies her mother and me.

We've been friends since high school and she doesn't call me like she used to because all she wants to talk about is her breakdowns, mood swings, the baby's health issues, and everything else baby related. I've tried to be supportive but anything I say elicits weird responses.

I'm sure some of that is normal but she was an entirely different human 5 weeks ago. Entirely different.. She's also calling the baby ""a project"" which disturbs me, too. Like, this is a person not a scrapbook.

She's given up on every hobby she had, we no longer have anything to talk about and that's super unlike us.

I'm honestly worried about psychosis due to the level of mood swings she's having and how out of touch she feels, but I have no materials suggesting whether that's even possible or not.

Anyone know anything about this at all? Is this normal?

1257,Stranger yelled at me that I’m a terrible mother and it just hurt so much,"This is my first time writing a post, but I read and follow often in this forum. Just looking for some support-

My LO is 12m and we’ve been pretty strict with quarantine this past year. My husband and I did tag-team parenting during workdays and honestly it was just so hard. I feel like I didn’t get the “village” that I really needed. I regularly question my ability as a parent even though my LO is growing/happy/healthy and hitting all the milestones. 

Well today was our first big outing. We drove 7.5 hours (supposed to be 5 but traffic) onto our first vacation. Get to the hotel and I have my husband unload and take the stuff to the room while I sit with the munchkin because we’re parked in a hotel loading area. Admittedly it was a tight driveway but we got as close as we could to the curb in an inconvenient spot bc there were two other cars parked in the convenient spots. Well those two cars obviously left (and were able to get by our car no problem) and then this BMW rolls in and I could see they were struggling to get by and my LO chose that moment to saturate the diaper and start to cry. So I take LO out of the car seat to soothe and walk around to the bmw with LO on my hip: “I’m sorry if it’s tight my husband is just running to the room he’ll be down in a second” — the woman and her husband immediately YELL that where we’ve parked is “inconvenient” and “ridiculous” (“yes, but if was the only spot at the time”) and I reiterate that hubs will be right down. The exchange got heated and I just said “listen, he’ll be f*ing down in a minute, I’m sorry, my LO just had an accident and I can’t move the car” to which lady calls me a “terrible mother to curse in front of your child” and that I should be ashamed of myself. I have been struggling with negative feelings about my parenting so much lately and it just pushed me over the edge. I told them to call the cops if they’re gonna complain that I’m blocking a driveway and went back to the car to sob alone on the curb.

My MIL is out of state, and although we have met several times, her and I are not close. She is not very communicative with me and it borders on being odd (to me). She calls/takes calls from my partner regularly but hasn’t checked up on me during this pregnancy at all….but wants to come down to help after the baby is born, with another sibling of his. I made a boundary early on and said I didn’t think visitors would be an issue, as long as it was a few weeks after my birth for me to recover/us to bond. 
She has already tried to suggest a different date, two weeks after my “due date” (which we know can change). I was bothered that she even tried to override what I had said…and my partner told her “no, sometime in January is going to be better for us”. There’s a couple other strange things she’s done during pregnancy that I will mention if anyone needs more background for why I feel so bothered.

Here’s the thing….the closer I get to my due date, the more apprehensive I am feeling about having long term visitors staying in our home, with the guise of being helpful…but actually making things uncomfortable. I don’t really know her. And she’s showing me that she doesn’t really want to make the effort to get to know me, or even check in about my journey. I’m also having some anxiety already and I want the most peaceful postpartum time that I’m able to attempt. This isn’t her first grandchild, just first by my partner.

1267,Create a “friends of baby” messenger group?,"Hi! This is my first post here and I’m writing with a question: Our first baby is due in about a month. I’m considering creating a “friends of baby ___” Facebook Messenger group, and I’m wondering if this is a good or bad idea. 

My wife just had a surprise video conference baby shower some old friends participated. It was great. 

This got me thinking that there are a number of people, those who worked to organize the shower, who already feel personal investment on our baby. This is something I’d like to further encourage among those friends (from the shower) but also our broader circle of friends and family. That’s why I’m thinking of creating a messenger group for “friends of the baby”. We don’t have much family and live in a rural area with no local friends yet, so I’m especially interested in this idea. 

We’d use it to let people know after we have the baby, to share a few photos without sharing them publicly online, and to announce milestones.

I think a lot of people are interested in the baby and excited for us and I’d like a forum to maintain and build on that, and to allow people to feel included and satisfy desires for more info. And this would prime people to become invested in our baby; it could be a start at building a community of support for the baby. Maybe in future these people can be baby’s friend, too. 

My instinct is to do this assumptively—proceeding on the assumption that people would like being on such a list. I guess they could mute it or opt out if the want to. I’d include the kinds of long-distance friends with whom we might talk on the phone with at least once a year, old and new good friends. 

Is there established etiquette on such things? I want to meet people where they are at. I don’t want to annoy people or make them roll their eyes. But I’m also game to take a lead in building a community around our baby.

1270,How to cope when we don’t have anyone to turn to for babysitting over night?,"Husband and I have a daughter (15 mo). We love her and she is doing so well. Everything is okay with eating, diapers and development. She has a lot of words and is very social, so I bet she has a lot to process every night. 

The nights are rough. She cries a lot every night and has a hard time finding calm and sleep. It has been this way since birth. Luckily she has finally found a teddy and a doll she loves and seeks out as comfort during the night. She co-sleeps with father and he can soothe her with humming and cuddles. I sleep in another room but breastfeed whenever she needs. We make sure to balance between helping her at night and relaxing alone, and make a great team.

She has never spent the night anywhere else and the longest babysitting she has had was 4 hours. She is babysat maybe once-twice a month by my moher or my SIL. We want more babysitting and sleepovers, but we don’t have anyone to ask. Other family either lives too far away or is too old or passed away. My mother has a 4 hours max because she has fatigue, and my SIL has 3 little kids. We are not comfortable paying someone outside of the family for the time being.

We have tried the following:
* Putting to sleep in pram on extra rough nights
* Give medicine/pain killers when needed
* Are open about the fact that nights are hard and ask for babysitting/sleepovers from time to time
* We will try to help her fall asleep on her own in her own bed instead of co-sleeping

Are there other tips and tricks my husband and I should give a try? All advice are welcome",beyondthebump
1271,"I don't feel bonded with my daughter and I'm angry at my ""support system"" for doing this to me.","I gave birth to my baby daughter on May 13th of this year, and it was the most important day of my life. I'll never forget the love I felt when they put her in my arms, and the pride that I felt when I saw her face for the first time. The first few days of her life were perfect, and her Father and I stayed alone in the hospital together learning how to be parents and getting to know our girl.

When I left the hospital, I felt so full of hopes and dreams, so happy, in ways I hadn't been since I was probably a toddler. My life finally felt exciting, and good. But as soon as we got home with our baby, things started to go South.

My MIL had already come in all the way to Houston from San Antonio with my 13 year old BIL to visit us, which meant holding my baby for 7 hours while I floated around my house and took some time to rest. I felt she had overstepped a boundary somehow, but didn't know where or what. Regardless, they left when my daughter woke hungry and crying, and I woke up disoriented being handed a screaming child. I cried.

Following an undisclosed event a few days later, in which my husband and I fought awfully and I felt my motherhood was being threatened, my SIL and her partner paid us a visit. I thought we'd had a great time, but it turns out they called my husband the next day, told him something that they'd thought I'd done while I was showering, and got him fighting with me over the phone at 8 in the morning while I was trying to nurse my daughter. All of this just two weeks after my daughter's birth. I put my daughter down in her crib and cried again for the millionth time in days.

Why did everyone have to start causing drama in my life the second I came home happy with my baby? My pregnancy was already hard enough because of these things.

Eventually, my milk supply tanked and I felt almost traumatized by my child. Looking at her made me sad. Hearing her cry caused me panic. Her trying to coo at me and receive my attention just made me want to walk away and cry. Suddenly, my beloved, most wanted baby girl was a stranger to me. The child I was so in love with, was even prepared to raise alone, was no longer mine. And it wasn't my hormones that betrayed me, it was my loved ones. I cried the hardest I'd cried in years. I realized I had lost my chance to be the happy, loving mother in these first few months that I deserved and wanted so badly.

I felt cheated and hurt. Eventually, I stopped holding her most of the days, and stopped nursing entirely. All of this made me so sad I couldn't put it into words, but I couldn't get over the sadness and frustration that I had been put through. I regretted having her. I wished I would have known what things would be like 11 months ago.

Now, she's two months old, I'm seeking help, and doing the best I can to bond with her. But I still feel every day like she's just not mine anymore, and I feel like my baby has been taken from me.",beyondthebump

1281,Sleep and nap schedule at 4 months with extremely short naps,"I'm struggling to figure out how to drop a nap. My baby is about 4.5 months old but he only takes 30 minute naps. This is not a sleep regression nap thing, he has consistently always taken 30 minute naps (at least for the past 2.5 months). I have absolutely no idea how to drop a nap. I've seen some parents on here talking about how their 4 month old takes three 30 minute naps. How??? Even if wake windows are all 2 hours long that's still only 7.5 hours of ""daytime."" I am struggling so much to figure out how to drop a nap.

What we're doing now:

Awake: 6:15-6:45

1st nap: \~8:00

2nd nap: \~10:00

3rd nap: \~12:30

4th nap: \~3:00

5th nap: \~5:30

Bedtime: 8:00 (I would like bedtime between 7-8, usually he's out by 7:45)

I'm using the Huckleberry app so it is giving me the Sweetspot nap times. I know there is an option for a 4 nap schedule but for us that only moves the naps 10 minutes ahead and then it always seems to add in a 5th nap anyway. I'm really confused by this. 

He doesn't struggle to go down for these naps, it usually takes 10 minutes or less for him to fall asleep. 

I just don't know how we're going to get to 5 months and be doing 3 naps if he is taking 5 naps right now and they are still only 30 minutes long. I feel like 6:00 would be way too early of a bedtime so I just can't figure out how we would end up dropping a nap. 

Right now his night time sleep is amazing. He goes down at 8:00 and does not wake typically until 6:15 (sometimes I need to wake him in the morning because he could sleep longer). He does not eat during the night (EFF) because we try to get all his calories in in the daytime. 

How do you drop a nap? What kind of a schedule do you use if your baby is a 30 minute napper consistently at 4 months?",beyondthebump

Then I had a baby and have been staying home with both kids. My son is so bored at home now and hasn’t really been around other kids in over a year. He wants my constant attention, which is hard for me to give with a new baby. It breaks my heart to see him have to play by himself most of the day. I obviously play with him when I can and we spend most of our days outside, but I know how desperately he needs socializing with other children and to get some time to just play and be a kid outside of our home. So we finally decided to put him back in daycare after my hubs and I both got vaccinated and our area finally started to open up again. I was SO excited for him to get out of the house and get back in school! Now with the Delta variant, we feel like we have to keep him at home longer to not only protect him, but my infant as well.

I'm fine with it for now, she's fine with it for now, so we should be good, right? Except Grandma worries I'm going to spoil her and Mamaw worries I'm going to hurt my back. Dad asks ""Does she ALWAYS nap like that? Is that safe?"" Great Grandma says she is getting to old for that, and MIL says she needs to be more independent.

1288,Anyone notice patterns with Baby’s growth spurts/times of rapid development?,"I’m noticing that our daughter has a distinct period of time in which she will start acting irritable and tired on the exact day she turns a week older. For example, she turned 22 weeks on Thursday. She was a little irritable on Thursday, she didn’t want to finish her bottles and she took awful naps. So we started trying to stretch her wake windows a bit more because I’m thinking that she is likely just developing/growing and needs more awake time. Yesterday was a bit worse than Thursday, but she did take a decent nap in the pm. So far today has been exhausting. She is making this “mmm” sound and getting so frustrated, and she won’t stop kicking her legs and just constantly moving and whining while making the “mmm” sound. She normally is happy if you pay attention to her and engage with her by bouncing, making faces, looking at toys, etc. For the past couple of days none of this makes her happy. 

I have noticed this in the past too, where she is extra tired/hungry/cranky starting on a seemingly random Thursday. Then usually by Sunday things start to get better.

1294,Sick of being caught in the middle between my family and my husband.,"Sorry for any spelling issues, I'm exhausted and emotional and need to get this out. 

The hardest part about having my daughter (1yo) has been being stuck between trying to keep my family (mainly my parents) happy and my husband happy. I'm failing miserably. 

My parents live in my home town (where my husband met me) 6 hours away from us. Our daughter is their first ever grandchild and they are absolutely smitten. They send copious amounts of gifts and love and want to be involved in my daughters life, which I absolutely adore. 

Unfortuntely my mum and sibling have serious mental health issues which have flaired up a lot since bubby was born. My mum had a melt down and had to be hospitalised in our city immediately after bubby was born, leaving my Dad with no-where to stay except with us for about a month. This left my husband feeling like he'd lost bonding time with our daughter, which I felt awful about. 

My folks have visited and stayed multiple times since, usually for lengthy periods of time because the distance means if you're going to visit it needs to be worth the trip, they spend a lot of money and time  travelling so I can't as them to keep it to 2-3 days. Or because there has been a crisis and they need to stay in our city. 

My husband doesn't mind them visiting but asks for some notice. Which is fair. But he's also said he struggles with having visitors for weeks at a time because he feels uncomfortable in his own home after a while and misses quality family time. This usually results in him getting upset, depressed and moody. 

I feel like the worst partner and daughter in the world because I can't fix these issues. When my family have to stay because they're in crisis, like when my sibling recently attempted suicide or when my mum was hospitalised I want to help them and welcome them into our home, but I do and my husband is put out and gets upset. His feelings are totally valid and justified, I just don't know what to do. 

Even when it's not about a crisis and my family just want to see us and our daughter I just can't bring myself to say no, I love them and want to see them too. I miss them so much and it's so hard not having my family support here like all my mum friends do. 

I feel like I'm in the wrong no matter what I do. I'm pretty sure my husband will forever resent me for my Dad staying with us in the month post bubbies birth. Which sucks as well because that was really hard for me too. My mum was in hospital, my Dad was miserable and my husband shut down on me all the month after my traumatic birth.. I felt so lost and alone and no one seemed to care. Now a year on I'm the bad guy for not kicking my Dad out. 

I'm honestly lost for what to do here, I'm miserable and feel like no one is ever on my side. I'm pretty sure I had/have PPD and PPA and no one cared/s.  If anyone has any tips for navigating this then my goodness please tell me. I've read about how once you get married you should always stick up for your partner, I want to, I really do. But that can't mean abandoning my parents or locking them out of my daughters life right?",beyondthebump

1321,Looking for baby sleep advice,"Let me start by saying I'm a first time mother and the majority of my baby information comes from the internet since I'm also the first of my family and friends to have a kid. Everything I read online is contradictory - baby is getting too much sleep, baby isn't getting enough sleep, etc. I've tried everything and now I'm desperate for some advice from someone who has dealt with this same issue.

Daughter is 7 weeks old. From about 4-5.5 weeks, she started sleeping great. Bed at 10, wake every four-five hours to feed, then up around 7. But for the last week and a half, come 10:30 she is WIDE AWAKE. Not really fussy, just super awake. She usually stays that way until about 1 when I feed her again and she goes to sleep. Sometimes I can get her to fall asleep in her swing, but she wakes up when I try to move her (She sleeps great in her crib every other time, including after 1am, and usually falls asleep within 5 minutes of being put down). 

I've tired more nap time during the day, less nap time during the day, earlier bed time, later bed time, earlier night feeding, dream feeding.. nothing is working. I go back to work in two weeks and I need to get this fixed! Does anyone have any advice??",beyondthebump

Our baby screamed the almost the whole flight. The airport lost all our luggage including our stroller. We ran out of snacks and had hangry, exhausted kids. But guess what? That village of helpers everyone talks about showed up. One mom brought over lollipops on the plane that finally brought some peace. Another mom from first class came back to offer me a beer. Several strangers told me we were fine and/or doing great. A grandma talked to my toddler while I changed the baby in the airport bathroom. And yet another mom tossed pouches on our table while my husband was ordering food and I was dealing with meltdowns. I don’t know if I would’ve survived that day without these women. I don’t know their names, I don’t know who they are, but they were my village when I needed one the most. And I am forever grateful!

1324,Considering leaving my job and pulling from daycare due to COVID…not sure what to do. :(,"We moved to Delaware from Arizona in early  February, and both my husband and I were out of jobs until April. We’re both now steadily employed and making good money, and we have our daughter in daycare. My office told everyone to be back in office starting 2/3 weeks ago. This is insane to me. I work in healthcare. Both my husband and I are vaccinated, but our 3 year old isn’t. Daycare just dropped the mask policy this week for those who are vaccinated…but no proof of vaccination needed. 

The situation now is: we are currently staying with family while we find a home to buy. We have a month or 2 left until we can really start looking (had some catching up to do from being without jobs for 3 months). I’m also 9 weeks pregnant. However, we can live (and save, especially with hardly any bills at the moment) comfortable on just my husbands salary. I was going to leave my job anyway in February as the plan is to stay home for at least the first year with baby like we did with our daughter. But of course, we will (hopefully) have our own home by then, or at least actively putting offers in. Now with COVID, we are considering doing this much sooner than we planned. I just feel really weird and not right not working when we don’t have our own home yet. At the same time, our health and safety comes first. I also have no worries about going back to work and finding a job, as my field is always looking.

1328,6mo sleep -- screaming wakeups?,"Hi all,

My baby wakes up screaming in his sleep, usually night sleep, frequently. I'm trying to figure out if this is a normal sleep developmental phase or if I should be worried about our habits or even medically. 

It's 10pm here and baby went to bed approx 730pm (he had a late nap so this is a bit later than usual). We're a very go-with-the-flow trio, where we try to follow baby cues and get him to bed between 630 and 730. Since going to sleep, he's had 4 screaming wakeups. Now I know you might say - you rocked him to sleep, so he wants you to come back and rock him! No, his first sleep he was laying in his crib with his pacifier. Because he has trouble falling asleep without mom (me), we've been trying a plan where dad does book and relaxing time, then he lays down with baby in our bed and I join if he's fussing. Anyway, baby was calm and got moved to his crib before falling asleep. Other nights, he will fall asleep near us but with no movement or nursing and just his pacifier. 

I know that associations of being near us or wanting the pacifier again will lead to some wakeups, and we're fine with that. But he just woke up for the 4th time absolutely screaming. This 4th time, he wasn't soothed with a pacifier &amp; song from dad, he needed to nurse. His cries are SO upsetting to me and hard on us all!

A few things: he is EBF, the room wasn't too cold, he doesn't wake up when pacifier falls out but does often have it to go to sleep.

A big thing - once he wakes up after midnight or so, he comes into bed with us. I practice as safe as possible cosleeping. He loves to be near me but does still wake up several times a night - but not hollering. I give him a pacifier or nurse him. 

I want to leave him in a safe sleep environment in the evening when I'm awake (I won't leave him in our bed after he falls asleep, for example) but also we are not interested in any sleep training that does not involve quickly responding to crying.

Can anyone soothe ME and tell me these super frequent wakeups are part of the process? Anything else I can ""check"" to help him have longer sleep cycles in the early part of the night?",beyondthebump
1329,Anyone else who’s in a COVID surge area considering taking their toddlers out of daycare/Montessori?,"I have a 20 month old son who I had placed in Montessori in March. Things with covid had definitely simmered down where we’re at and he was doing great. Obviously getting colds every other week but that’s expected. 

Then fuckin delta came to play. Last week his teacher tested positive for COVID and his class shut down for 10 days. Every day I got an email that another classmate (total 5 out of 12) tested positive for covid. Thankfully my son did fine and tested negative after 10 days. But this prompted us to reconsider having him in a school setting during this current surge and with a newborn due in 5 weeks. I know I can’t keep him in a bubble forever and COVID isn’t going anywhere anytime soon but right now it’s kinda crazy. I work in family practice and have had many patients so sick and die in just recent two weeks compared to barely seeing cases just a month ago. 

Anyway just wanted to see where other parents who might have some more flexibility (definitely not the case for a lot and I empathize completely) are at.

1336,Birthday party and covid,"Looking for some ideas here.  Our son is turning 1 and we were planning on having a small family gathering next weekend.  Obviously my son is unvaccinated, as is my four year old.  We are keeping the celebration small.  We are planning on 10 adults ( 2 great grands, 4 grands, 4 aunts/uncles), and two children (cousins) attending.  Of those, 5 adults are vaccinated, 2 (still unvaccinated) had covid in April, and 3 are unvaccinated.  The two kids have also had covid and are obviously unvaccinated.  

My kids have not had covid but are in daycare.  We are in New Jersey where there is a relatively high population vaccinated.  

I am nervous about the party with the delta variant.  However I feel like I might be overreacting.  Is it reasonable to ask anyone unvaccinated to wear kn95 masks when indoors?  What about those that have had covid but not the vaccine? 

I don’t want to make things awkward but I also don’t want to expose my kids more than needed (not going to daycare is not an option for us).  I am not opposed to cancelling the party too, even though my parents will still fly in (they had covid but are unvaccinated).  Thoughts?",beyondthebump

I'm in the UK and know in the US this is much more common, but here its relatively early. 

He is ebf and currently 10 weeks old and only wants me. He loves boob, wont have a dummy and has only had a bottle a handful of times.

I guess I'm after other peoples experiences with going back after 3 months, did your babies settle and acceot things like bottles and dummies when you weren't there?

1341,US Insurance: looking for other people's input,"So I just got off the phone with my insurance company and hospital.

Background: I have an HSA account with a $2,800 individual deductible/out of pocket max and $5,400 family deductible/out of pocket max. (Which, yes I know is great compared to some) I hit my individual deductible in March sometime due to pregnancy complications.

I was told (before giving birth) that the infant is covered under me for the first 30 days and I need to add the infant to insurance within the first 30 days. No problem.

I gave birth 5/11. And added her about a week later. Great. Then I started getting bills -the hospital billed the infant under her own bill and me under and different one. Ok, no big deal I thought, she's covered under me for the first 30 days and covered under my deductible. WRONG. Because she's billed separately she's on her own and on her own deductible.

So I called the hospital billing - they said they can't bill the infant under me. The infant HAS to be on their own and insurance needs to backdate her coverage to her birth date. Which is all fine and dandy, but then all her medical cost/hospital stay/birth costs have their own deductible, rather than being under my deductible (which I've hit). I don't understand how the insurance can say she's covered under me, but then the hospital refuses to bill under me.

Gah, sorry for the rant. There are a bunch of other things that happened too which I won't get into here - I'm just so frustrated and feel like I'm not getting very straight answers from anyone. Has anyone else experienced this?  How can insurance cover an infant under the mom, but a hospital not bill the infant to the mom?

At this point I'm leaning towards just paying the bill for my baby rather than go through the ringer again with the insurance/hospital, but I came to reddit to see if anyone else has had a similar experience or suggestions.",beyondthebump

New mama here so my bf and I are looking for something new to help out our little one sleep at night, he is two weeks old and when we first brought him home we would wake him to feed (formula feeding) we were told to wake him to feed every 2 to 3 hrs and to feed him 2oz it worked for a bit but we noticed he would cry a lot more, so we asked family for some advice most family members said to not wake him and to only feed when he cried and to maybe up his feeding to 3oz - 4oz instead of 2oz but I was kinda worried to go straight into 3 or 4oz. We tried 3 he didn’t finish so we went down to 2.5oz-2.75oz we noticed he would do a little bit better with that feeding amount when it came down to going to bed he would do fine and would wake because of a diaper change or feeding, the only hard part was trying to stay awake while feeding but we would manage to stay up till he would knock out again. These past 2-3 days we noticed he started to cry a lot more and his feedings would increase to 3oz sometimes he would still be hungry after we just fed him and would make him another 2oz bottle from there which were not sure if that’s a good thing or bad thing.. just some info about our baby he was born on July 11th weighed in at 6oz 12 lbs now at two weeks he weighs 8oz so we’re not sure if we’re doing a good job at the feeding part.. or are we over feeding? But last night was to crazy we would feed him almost every hour to two hours and after his feeding and burping him he would still fuss and cry hysterically! He stood up from 1am-6am he would take little naps here and there but idk if you would even calls them naps he would just stay up! We tried everything we could to help him sleep but nothing worked.

I had a pretty rough time with PPD/PPA and thyroid issues, and self confidence and boundaries with family this year.

I do want to have more than one child, but I am worried about getting into such a dark place with PPD again. I worry that I won't be able to cope with having a toddler and a new baby if I end up with similar struggles postpartum. 

I'm really digging getting back to myself too, but I feel that if I really get back into the groove of my own hobbies and my business, I will struggle giving it all up again for another baby. I wonder if it would be better for my mental health to have babies closer together rather than starting things up again only to stop for another year while the baby would be little.

I know motherhood and parenthood in general comes with a lot of heavy emotions, so I’m wondering.. is this normal (whatever that means)??

I had a “birth plan” that didn’t go as planned. He ended up being delivered emergency c section. In some ways I have still been grieving that. (7 months later 😕).

1365,Feeding solids suggestions for 9 month old?,"I’m having trouble getting my 9 month old to eat solids other than puffs. She loves her purées and will even spoonfeed herself if she’s really interested in a purée, so I thought she would be into real food - doesn’t appear to be the case! 

She hasn’t quite developed her pincer grasp yet so maybe that’s part of it. So far I’ve tried cutting very small pieces of soft food (carrots, tender chicken, potato, banana, avocado, egg etc). Typically most pieces slip out of her hand, but she can rake a piece or two into her mouth. After that she stops and just plays with the food or loses interest altogether. It often falls out of her hand when she brings her hand up to her mouth since she doesn’t use a pincer grasp. However she is a champ at eating puffs since they somehow stick to her hand, so she can shove them into her mouth no problem! But usually I resort back to purées since she hardly eats her food pieces.

I’m afraid that since she can only successfully feed herself puffs that she’s already a picky eater and that’s all she’ll want to eat. 

Anyone else have this issue? What did you do? 

We are too anxious for BLW. We tried it earlier on but had a terrifying incident where her mouthful was too large and she turned bright red while gagging. It could have been a choking episode since she turned so red. Ever since that, BLW does not seem worth the risk.",beyondthebump

1372,FIO &amp; MOTN wake ups,"LO is almost 4 months and we've been doing FIO to prep for sleep training. It's been successful about 50% of the time, with her falling asleep independently within 20 minutes. The other 50% I just have to go in and hold in her binky and put a hand on her chest for a few minutes and she'll be out.

How should I handle MOTN wake ups? They're almost always due to hunger. She'll usually go down about 7pm, wake around 1am and eat, wake at 3-4am and eat, then be up for the day at 6am. she has reflux so I have to hold her for 15 minutes after each feeding , during which she always falls asleep.  If I put her down and she wakes back up, should I let her fuss it out for the usual 20 minutes to see if she goes back out? I've been rocking her to sleep for MOTN wake ups but it's been increasingly harder to get her back to bed.

Occasionally, I do warrant and court searches on him. You'd be surprised how many states have the ability to search the criminal history of anyone for free. Anyway, I checked this morning and there were a few new citations. The most recent grabbed my attention. It was something along the lines of having a structure without a permit. While that could mean multiple things, the fact that he also has multiple citations for jaywalking (which police generally only give when they know there's something else afoot), and petty larceny, I'm pretty sure it means he's homeless, and he set up some sort of shelter outside and was hit with a ticket.

Honestly, I'm not even sure how it makes me feel. I guess I feel like his spiral has gone down so far that he only has a limited amount of time left before he gets himself killed.

I'm worried because he's never loved drinking his formula -- he hates being stationary for more than 2 seconds. He's just super active.

But it has to completely quiet, no stimulants, no toys nearby, nothing. As soon as any sound goes off or someone walks by, his attention is lost and he wants to get down to investigate what's happening. 

He has learned to drink water from a straw cup, but begrudgingly, because he just doesn't stay still for it. I have to hold the straw cup up to him and offer it, and he will maybe take a tiny sip and then push me away to continue crawling or playing with toys. He won't pick it up or hold it on his own.

She said if the retractions look worse or the owlet reads under 90% for a significant amount of time to go to the ER. 

I also want to add that at night he sounds so congested. I used a bulb syringe and got a huge booger out last night. We bought a nose frida today and are going to try that with the shower steam and saline.

1409,I resent my dog,"I'm sure you're thinking that I'm a terrible person, I'm thinking it too. I never wanted to be one of those people that think about rehoming their dog, but I am. I won't do it because my husband bought him for me after I begged him for a golden retriever. He's an AKC registered Golden, so he was expensive. He was my first baby. I fed him the best food, groomed him weekly, took him on daily walks, trained him..... 

He's a part of our family, but as soon as we came home with our baby girl a year ago, something changed. Everything he did became annoying. Following me when I get food, jumping on the couch as soon as I sit down, pawing at me when he wants attention, his freaking loud snoring, sniffing my crotch, it's all so annoying and I hate it. He brought a dead bird inside a few weeks ago and I wanted to scream and put him in his kennel, but he's just being a dog, so I didn't. 

I'm so tired of having to pick up his poop outside, but that's my responsibility as his owner. The thing that made me write this post happened five minutes ago, I spent ALL DAY cleaning. I cleaned our nice area rug, vacuumed, washed the drapes, cleaned the baseboards... It was perfect, but then my dog came to my freshly cleaned rug and puked all over it.

I'm so frustrated. I'm 26 weeks pregnant, I'm tired, I have a one year old to chase around, and he's just become more of a nuisance and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. He's so good with our baby, but this past week he's been something else. He ate my lunch on Monday, tore up my baby's toy on Tuesday, jumped on my bump yesterday, and now he puked on my clean rug. 

To the dog lovers on here, I'm sorry. I never thought I'd be this type of person. I know I love him deep down, but he's trying my patience and I'm fantasizing about rehoming him.",beyondthebump
1410,TSA Fiasco Over Baby Formula,"Anyone else have a bad experience with the TSA and baby formula?

I traveled with my 8 month old son for the first time this past week. 

I purposely didn’t bring breastmilk through TSA Security. On my flight down, I had a ton of sealed formula bottles in a gallon sized bag. I was just waved through once it was declared. 

On my return flight today, I was told my formula needed to be opened up for testing (not going to happen for obvious reasons). I was told in order to keep the formula I needed to undergo a pat down and all of my belongings had to go through enhanced security. Everything was swabbed and picked through by the TSA agent. This level of enhanced security over formula does not appear to be in alignment with what is on their website. I was told the website doesn’t have their procedures. It was horrible and humiliating. All the while, I was holding my 8 month old.

Any good advice beside taping her in! LOL

She is not ready to potty train, she gets her stuff off and pees on the floor, no outward signs or vocalizations of need to go.  If we don't catch it quickly she will play splash in it! 🤢🤮

1415,My 9 month old boy fell down the stairs today,"I am not even sure why am I posting this, I'm just about to go to bed but I know I won't be able to sleep.

It was a very normal day except that his first nap was very short. I remember getting a bit frustrated because of it, I only had a towel wrapped around me because I didn't even manage to have a shower. Don't even know how it happened but LO  fell down the stairs in our house. When I heard it, smth like heavy hitting the ground a few times and then a cry, my heart dropped. I thought I would die right then and there. I immediately ran to him and picked him up thinking this it it, that there is no way he would be ok from a fall like this. He cried so badly for a few minutes but then started making his usual funny noises and I thought that I am dreaming, that my head is playing with me creating a happy illusion. I called my husband to come home immediately, I checked LO and couldn't find anything wrong with him but a little scratch mark on his shoulder. Our stairs have carpet on top of them so I think it saved us. 

We took him to the hospital where they watched him for 4 hours, did an Xray for his shoulder and told us that everything looks OK and we were allowed to go home. I had him in my arms pretty much the whole time when were in there, I felt so bad and embarrassed and expected to be mam shamed by the docs and nurses but I wasn't. They were surprisingly understanding. My husband on the other hand was the opposite: "" He could have died. Do you understand how lucky you were? What were you thinking? What were you even doing? He better not have a head injury "" just some of the things he was saying.

I felt so lonely because I didn't need him to make me feel bad, I feel awful enough as it is I feel like the worst mother ever, I feel like I betrayed my child and all day today I kept saying to him ""mama is so sorry"". My husband told me it didn't look like I understand how serious it is and I asked him would me commiting suicide or getting into a depression or getting drunk or hurting myself be better? Would it make him feel better if I suffered more or in a different way, the way he expected?

We had practiced gentle hands and talked about the new baby before my son was born, so she is very gentle and happy and helpful older sister. 
But recently she has started throwing things and acting out along with increase in yelling. She will call us to get our attention and then throw the things which she has in her hand( toys, remote, phone, books, anything)
We have tried ignoring her tantrums, talking and explaining things to her calmly( though she does not understand completely), even getting upset and mad at her at times when our patience has run out. It seems like nothing is working. The yelling and throwing of things hasn't gone down. We have been reading the happiest toddler on the block and in the past the fast food rule and ignoring had worked to stop her yelling  but now even that is not working.

We have a baby that is almost 11 months old and we are really struggling on figuring out when to try for our next. We don’t have much experience with kids and toddlers, so we don’t know what to expect considering where LO will be developmentally in the future, and that doesn’t help lol. 

We prefer a slow and steady pace in life and would like our LO to be a little more independent to make things a little easier, but we also want our children to be pretty close in age for their sake. On paper, 3 years sounds great in terms of taking our time and having a more independent LO, but it might be a little too spaced out especially since we want to have 3-4 children. Two under 2 sounds like chaos lol, so 2 years apart is the earliest we’re wanting to space them out. Right now we’re thinking we’ll aim for a 25-30 month age difference. 

2.5 sounds like the obvious compromise between 2 and 3, but I’m wondering if there would be any real difference in our experience dependent on those extra 5 months?! Especially in terms of LO’s independence? The timing of the 25 month gap is appealing in terms of not being pregnant in the dead of winter (we live in a state with extremely harsh winters and getting out to walk saved me during my last pregnancy) and it also works out well for my husband having paternity leave over the holidays.

1450,Is Philips Avent electric breast pump good? Which is the best electric breast pump?,"**Pumping can have a method** of causing us human moms to feel similar to drain machines. Yet, we as a whole need to do whatever we can for our infants — and there are a couple of approaches to make the interaction somewhat less, indeed, awful.

Regardless of whether you plan to only breastfeed (regularly alluded to as ""EBF""), it is useful to have a breast pump close by. Why? It can assist with expanding your milk supply, particularly in those early days. Breast milk is delivered on a market interest premise, so pumping for a couple of moments in the wake of nursing or including a pumping meeting an hour or so after the child completed can up your stock.

You'll likewise need to pump so different guardians can take care of container feed child — particularly convenient for those center of-the-night feedings. (You don't need to do them all yourself, Mom!) And on the off chance that you at any point need to be away from the child for a night out with your accomplice or an evening with companions, a breast pump gives you the opportunity to do as such.

Obviously, in case you're anticipating breastfeeding subsequent to getting back to work, you'll need a breast pump so you can keep your stock up, have a reserve in your home cooler, and ease engorgement when you're at the workplace.

**Kinds of breast pumps**

There are four fundamental kinds of breast pumps:

**Twofold electric breast pumps:** These incredible electric models let you pump the two breasts immediately, significant if speed is a worry.

**Single-electric breast pumps:** You'll just have the option to pump each breast in turn, which can take longer. On the addition to side, this expense not exactly a twofold electric pump.

**Battery-worked breast pumps:** These can be increasingly slow through batteries before long. The upside of a battery-worked pump is that they're convenient and accommodating in the event that you don't approach a power plug, (for example, when you're driving to work or voyaging).

**Manual breast pumps:** These are lightweight, convenient, and economical. The disadvantage? You'll do a great deal of the work yourself and you may not get as much milk thus.

Shut framework pump or emergency clinic grade breast pump: Also called ""flood assurance,"" a shut framework pump is one that is closed from the milk by a boundary. This is the most hygenic sort of pump, as the obstruction keeps milk from getting into the machine, which can make cylinders and little pieces hard to clean. They additionally will in general be more costly than open-framework pumps.

Open-framework pump: These don't have a boundary between the milk and the pump component, so milk moves through tubes and other little pieces into the jug, and hence may interact with the pumping system. Open-framework pumps are typically more affordable than shut framework pumps.",beyondthebump
1451,8 month sleep regression?,"For the past 12 days it seems my 8.5 month old has been regressing? There’s been three nights since this started he slept through the night, and that is what has me wondering if this is actually a regression. 

LO wakes up at 6-7:30 depending on the screaming the night before and stays awake 2.5-3 hours before the first 45 minute nap. He then spends 3-4 hours awake before the second nap which ranges from 45 min to 1.5 hours. Then bedtime is 7:30-8 depending on when he woke up in the morning. 

He just recently started a 2 nap schedule and naps fine during the day. He’s working on popping his 6th tooth out so I’m sure that has a lot to do with it. 

We give him infant Tylenol if we notice he’s chewing on his sleep sack or wrist but try to not give him meds unless we really feel we need to. Sometimes that calms him enough we can put him in his crib drowsy but most of the time that results in screaming. 

Ultimately either myself or my husband had to hold LO until we know he’s not fake sleeping before we put him back to bed. Is that a mistake? If we just let him cry he never stops and I don’t want him to get to the point of puking. 

He naps in a pack and play down stairs with the same white noise as in his crib. Should that change? Is there something we’re doing wrong? Did we muck up sleep training? Is there an end to this regression?",beyondthebump
1452,Help me figure out what is going on with our 6 week old,"She's gaining weight fine, plenty of wet nappies. But she has at best guess got something digestive going on. We know she suffers from constipation, and put movicol in her formula. She alternates between hard screaming poos and constant squits because we can't get the dose right, we put a bit in each bottle, sometimes more/less depending on her last few poos, but it's such a fine balancing act.

She seems constantly in discomfort or overtired, she's only sleeping 7 hours a day and is awake 13 hours at a stretch. She's clearly shattered but despite all our efforts (swaddle, white noise, dummy, jiggling the cot, leaving her to fuss a bit, hold to sleep, feed to sleep, propping up the cot on an incline, covering it up with a muslin) she barely sleeps all day. We spend half the day trying to settle her, multiple hours each. I'm worried the lack of sleep is harming her development. It's also driving me fucking mental. Something is going on stopping her from sleeping.

It's especially frustrating not knowing what is going on - if we even understood it things would be better, even if we couldn't do anything about it. 

It doesn't seem to fit anything obvious.. she does dribble out some milk after eating but our first daughter was way more sicky, without all these other issues. We hold her upright and burp her thoroughly, hold her upright and bounce her before laying her down, doesn't help. So maybe not reflux?

It doesn't obviously fit colic because she's not worse in the evenings, it's between late morning and late evening. She doesn't cry consistently for hours, but she is crying for about 20 minutes out of every hour. She sometimes pulls up her legs and kicks and cries but we think it's poo/wind because quite often we burp her/she poos/we pedal her legs and she farts a bit, and then she's happy again - for ten minutes. 

Is it a developmental thing at 6 weeks? A growth spurt, sleep regression?

Is it a milk intolerance? We've got a history of that in our family, but she doesn't have blood in her poo or diarrhoea. The doctor said changing formula wouldn't help anything, but can that be true? Could another formula help with whatever the fuck is going on?

Is it she's just an easily overstimulated baby? But even on nursery days when our 3 year old isn't there and we can focus solely on settling her, keeping a quiet environment etc, she still will not settle. 

She's got worse this week, she was sleeping up to 4 hours last week and now she's down to 1-2 at a time. My husband got 2.5 hours sleep last night.

She will eat and eat small amounts and initially suck furiously on the bottle, but doze off constantly so that she's never full enough to sleep properly. She pops awake within 5 minutes of being put down, has 1oz then dozes off again, despite toe tickling, nappy change, stripping off her onesie etc. I sometimes drop her an inch onto a cushion so she startles awake, but it still doesn't help her stay awake enough to feed. She's too tired to eat but too hungry to sleep.

She isn't calmed by being held on us, she climbs up you and cranes back to look at the lights. 

We tried sitting her in a vibrating chair, which helps her poo, but she cries within 10 minutes there and won't sleep in it.

Is she windy simply because she's sucking in air from the crying?

Breastfeeding has gone down the toilet since last week, she won't latch as she's too unsettled or hungry, she cries at the breast and pushes it away. My supply has always been shit so I don't blame her, now my supply is basically 1oz a day from pumping and it's barely worth carrying on. The only time she'll breastfeed is the middle of the night.

All of this while our 3 year old is also pulling at your elbow going 'mummy mummy listen, do this, open this..' She's getting 4 hours a day of videos and tablet games because we can't pay attention to her, and we're much snappier with her, which is unfair on her and shit.

We'll get some infacol drops but I'm not sure what else to try. Is it just that she's 6 weeks old and we have to ride it out for now? Any thoughts appreciated!!",beyondthebump

1454,Advice for 4 month sleep regression?,"My baby started sleeping through the night at a little past 2 month mark. I’m talking dropping full on sleep from 9:30 to 7 am sleep… it was AMAZING. No middle of the night bottle, nothing. He is now 16 weeks and I believe we have hit the 4 month sleep regression. He now sleeps a good chunk from 8:30 pm to 1 am and then is up every hour. He wakes up and just screeches in his crib until we give him his pacifier. He then can fall asleep very quickly but is typically back up again within the hour and the cycle starts over.

Do I reintroduce night feedings? He is eating around 35 ounces of breast milk a day so I know he is getting plenty. He hasn’t had a night feeding in over a month so I’d hate for him to go back to expecting those if he doesn’t need it. Should I let his more playful screeches turn to crying and just let him be? The pacifier works but it is exhausting getting up every hour to put it back in.

1461,Baby fussy when drinking expressed breast milk at night,"Hi everyone - little one is 5 weeks old and we've been learning his habits and routines. My wife expresses breast milk in bottles, and we also supplement with formula.

Recently, when feeding our baby at night (12a to 5a), he gets really fussy when we try to feed him breast milk. He'll drink 1 Oz then starts flailing his body as if it's painful. If we persist through it, he'll continue to drink more.

We've tried burping him (doesn't really burp after 1 Oz of breast milk), waiting until he's really hungry, and soothing him. Today, we kept trying to feed him as he hadn't eaten for 3-4 hours, and he finished 2.5 Oz. However, when burping him afterwards, he spit up what seemed like most of it. He seems to react similarly to formula, but not nearly as bad as breast milk.

Has this happened to anyone else? He's perfectly fine drinking expressed breast milk during the day. We've theorized he doesn't like breast milk that's older than a few hours (it was 2.5 hours out before feeding it to him). We're also worried about dairy sensitivity, but not sure why he would react more at night feedings than during the day.

1471,3 month old in daycare….will it get better?,"My 3 month old baby boy started daycare this week, as my maternity leave ended. I have been working from home since before the pregnancy and still working from home this week (they want us back in the office next week). I decided to start daycare this week, because I figured it might make the transition easier if I could take this week to get him whenever I want without having to leave the office. 

I honestly don’t know if things are going well or not. The daycare is highly rated and we did tours of multiple daycares before deciding on this one. My baby hasn’t always been a great napper. He wakes up after a short time and I usually have to help him get back to sleep to extend his nap. But he averages 4-5 hours of nap time per day. He has been getting about an hour total in naps at daycare and that is over 3 or 4 different naps. When we pick him up, he seems to be in a daze because he’s so tired. And he takes a nap when we get home and goes to bed early. The sad part about that for me is it takes away from our time together after work/daycare. 

He also has a weird smell after and smells like the daycare. My husband thinks it is the cleaner they are using and they are cleaning frequently due to covid (not a bad thing). Today, they asked to talk to me because he has refused his 2:30pm bottle for 2 days in a row, despite his crying and showing signs of being hungry. I appreciate them telling me what’s going on, but it felt like they were looking to me to fix it and I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do? 

I’m really struggling with having him in daycare. I am freaked out about covid (the rest of the family is vaccinated) and he just seems sooooo young to be in daycare. I don’t have any other options for his care. My coworker had a baby a week after me and she is asking to work from home through the end of the year and is keeping her baby at home. I desperately want to do that, but how can I possibly do both? As much as I am not liking daycare, is it worse for him to be home with me when I can’t give him my full attention 100% of the time?

 I'm so so bloody tired of being in pain. Since the start of the 3rd trimester I had pinched nerves, and prodromal labour waking me almost every night. Then even got hospitalised and c onstantly pumped with magnesium. The labour was a backlabour amplified by induction (2 minutes of a contraction followed by a 30 second break). The baby was stuck so I got an episiotomy and a 3rd degree tear which got mightily infected. The infection spread into my butt-muscle, and the cleaning of the wound has been the most painful traumatic thing I've ever endured (the L&amp;D department has apologised for the doctor messing up and basically torturing me pointlessly, both physically and psychologically). After I got discharged I was on pain meds for the infection for the next 6 weeks, unable to sit down or to walk ok. Then my milk finally really came in (postoperative by antibiotics and healing), and I couldn't even touch my breasts, my nipples were on fire for about a month. And now that everything seems to have leveled out and I was happy for a couple of days (back pain, sleep deprivation, new joint pain be damned), I got mastitis. 

I just want to not be in pain for a while. Is it too much to ask? Is this what motherhood feels like? Just constant pain? Does it get better?

1487,I didn't sign up to do this on my own.,"Just need to vent it out. Things used to be good. Husband would give me 2-3 weekday mornings to work out before he left for work. I would get some me time, come home, baby would wake up, we'd do our thing. Husband would come home around 4-430, we'd play, have dinner, go for a family walk and 5h3n bedtime routine. Life was good.


Then his boss got a promotion and he started doing triple the work for no extra pay. I'm lucky to work out once during the week. I still get baby up and am with her all day. He comes home around 630, eats dinner, is on his phone the whole time, and I end up doing bedtime routine by myself. I also do all the chores, errands, take care of dog, and cook by myself.


It's just lonely and exhausting. I'm grateful to be at home with her and not have to juggle a job or anything. I knew the majority would fall to me. But damn, I thought I'd get a little time each day to share the load.

1488,Am I overreacting?,"I guess every parent has that *one* thing that they excessively worry about, perhaps beyond what’s logical. For me, it’s keeping our LO out of the sun. She’s just 3 months old, so can’t wear sunscreen. So I keep her covered up and/or in the shade, which I don’t really think is me being a crazy parent. I do it even when we’re just walking around the block for 10mins (though if she’s outside for just a minute or two, that’s fine, like she doesn’t need a sun hat to go to the car lol). But my husband acts like I’m being totally irrational, and thinks I am fretting over nothing. He thinks that a bit of sun is fine, I guess we just have different ideas of ‘a bit of sun’. I keep trying to tell him that baby skin is super delicate and prone to burning, and honestly I’m worried about doing long term damage to her skin. Am I wrong???

1493,3 week old sleep question - is this my new normal?,"Hi everyone just reaching out for suggestions and to see if this is normal. I'm a FTM to a 3 week old who has some new sleeping patterns that are slowly killing me. Recently he stopped napping longer clips and now does these short (sometimes 10 minutes) micro naps throughout the day. At night he is better (used loosely).. he hates his bassinet so he fights sleeping, but eventually goes down for a longer 2 - 3 hour snooze from 9 to 11 then 12 - 2ish. Typically between 2am and 5am he is unconsolable and refuses to sleep and then from 5 to 8, provided he is sleeping on me or next to me in bed (i.e. me not sleeping), he goes down. My husband is back to work, so I'm sure you can imagine the wreck I currently am. Oh I should also mention this kid HATES swaddles. I have never met a child that hates being covered so much. He is an escape artist when it comes to them so I'm thinking that's not the issue.

I feel like I know the answer, and that is to pull away from my parents drastically till they can get their shit together - but I’m not ready to do that. 

My parents have been divorced over 20 years and still find every opportunity to bash one another. My mother much more than my father, she’s unfortunately just a very bitter person. But here’s the catch, she does everything for us. Many have told me I need to cut her off until she can stop being toxic but that just doesn’t seem like an option for me. She provides me with so much support in raising my child, I feel like I’d be cutting off my other hand. So what? I just have to listen to her tell me she won’t go to the first birthday if my father is there? (Yeah right!) I just have to listen to my father go on and on about how he’ll “never let her control what he does with his grandchild.” But also, “I’ll be coming to the party early and leaving early so I don’t have to be around your mother.” 

I immediately change the topic every time one of them brings the other up. I’ve told them both more than once that I don’t care how they feel, my child’s happiness does not revolve around them. Yet still! Here we are, having the same conversation for the 20th time. Yes, the whole family is invited. Yes, that means her grandparents. No, I will not disown my other parent to make you more comfortable.

1516,Sharing my holiday traditions with you.,"I’m gonna share the traditions I grew up with and plan on doing with my daughter and then I’m also going to share the ones my fiancé and I came up with that we plan to do with our daughter. 

Christmas Eve: Open one present, set out cookies for Santa and carrots for reindeer. 
Christmas morning: We had two rules on Christmas morning. You can’t open any presents until everyone is awake but you can open your stocking. Rule two is you have to have a pot of coffee made and ready before waking mom up. So my sister and I would run downstairs Christmas morning, start the coffee pot then go to the living room and eat the candy that was in the stockings, this gave my mom extra time to sleep in. 
We would get presents from Santa but clothes and stuffed animals were from Mrs. Claus because she knitted them for us. An empty milk carton, empty box of snack cakes, and candy wrappers would be around the coffee table with a note that said “The cookies were delicious but I was so hungry and thirsty -Santa”
At my grandmas house my cousins and I would get a present at the same time and had to open them at the same time, one year it was matching bracelets that had a special charm for each of us telling us why we got that charm, one year it was marshmallow guns and we took them outside to play, one year it was mugs and different flavors of hot chocolate. 
What my fiancé and I plan on doing for Christmas Eve (I saw this idea years ago on tumblr I think) we are going to let our daughter open a present but it’s going to be a box with new pajamas, snacks, and a Christmas movie and we’re going to wear the pajamas and eat snacks and watch a Christmas movie together. We plan on making each other a Christmas Eve box too, so he would pick out new pajamas for me and snacks that I like and I’d do the same for him. 


Halloween: There’s a small festival in my home town that happens every October and my mom makes Chili and potato soup, even though we buy tons of festival food. There’s a parade at the end of the weekend and we can watch it from my moms front porch, we usually just stay with her the weekend of the festival. 
    There’s a farm/market near us that has a carnival every year, there’s a pumpkin patch and you can pick your own pumpkins, there’s hay rides, mazes for little kids, food stands, apple cider slushees, face paintings, balloon animals. There’s another hay ride that takes you up the hill to the apple trees and you can pick your own apples. There’s also other types of fun games and stands to by cool things. Super fun!! 
We watch scary godmother every year and make the snacks from it. We also watch other Halloween movies. 
My fiancé and I plan on buying 3 pumpkins each year, one for me, baby, and him. We did this when I was pregnant and want to do it every year.

Valentine’s Day, my mom would always make my sister and I Valentine’s Day baskets with candy, bath bombs, small lotions. My stepdad would always get my sister and I presents too, so when he came to the house with something for my mom he would also have something for us. I want my fiancé to do this for our daughter. 

Easter, we got Easter baskets, even now we get them.  We just get candy, bath bombs, drinks, other small things we like. We did Easter egg hunts at my grandmas, when we got older they gave us scavenger hunts and clues to hunt down Easter baskets instead of eggs. 

Thanksgiving, we just did typical thanksgiving dinner. My fiancé’s birthday is very close to thanksgiving and he loves pumpkin pie, we’re just gonna eat a bunch of pumpkin pie that month.",beyondthebump

1525,Help - I want to quit breastfeeding.,"My baby is 3 weeks old today. 

She has been gaining weight well and is generally a good baby… but breastfeeding is awful. I can’t seem to get a good / deep latch with her, which results in a lot of “clicking” and milk leaking out the side of her mouth everywhere. I basically have to hold my breast to her mouth the entire time to ensure it doesn’t slip off her mouth. We saw a LC and they said she has a minor tongue tie, lip tie, and a narrow/sensitive palate that causes her to gag and resist a deeper latch. I’ve watched a million videos on positioning, latching, troubleshooting etc. and nothing seems to help. I am so frustrated and exhausted. I cry non-stop. 

She has also started screaming and clawing at the breast. I will try to latch her while she is frantically seeking and flailing her arms around, sometimes sticking her fists in her mouth instead, and when I finally get her “latched” it’s usually a horrible latch and she either pulls off screaming in a minute, it falls out of her mouth within minutes, or I break it to try and get a better latch. Repeat. It’s exhausting and demoralizing.  

Everyone says if she is gaining weight, this isn’t an issue. But it is. For me. I have had four blocked ducts in a week which has added to the stress. I am concerned she is fussy and upset between feeds because she is inhaling so much air, causing gas / tummy issues. I dread every single nursing session. I try to go into it with a positive mindset but I get so down when I am struggling and fighting with her to latch. I am so worried about breastfeeding that I can’t enjoy anything else. I feel resentful of her and can’t wait to pass her off to my husband so I can have a moment alone.  

My husband has been resistant to alternative feeding since theses issues started. He doesn’t want the expense of formula or the hassle of bottle feeding. He wants me to keep trying but I just feel like I can’t go on like this. I am so unhappy. My supply seems good but there is just something not connecting / working during breastfeeding. I can’t imagine going on like this for six more months. 

I need help. How can I switch to pumping and if needed, supplementing with formula? I don’t know where to start. I want to stop breastfeeding, like yesterday.  I think I need to for my mental health.",beyondthebump

1527,Help please! When did you know you needed professional help with solids or that something was different with your baby?,"TL;DR: LO is 8months and has been eating solids since 5.5months. solids has always been a huge battle and it's not getting better. Time to talk to ped/other medical professional? If so, who?


Sorry for the wall of text but wanted to see if other parents have had similar issues with solids. 

I'm beginning to suspect she either has some sort of sensitivity to foods or her mouth is very sensitive. 

We started purees at 5.5months and since then have been doing a combo of purees and baby led weaning. I usually give her some purees and then give her a bowl of appropriately sized/cut/cooked solids for her baby led weaning (blw) style. (She was able to sit upright comfortably and had the hand eye coordination to put food in her mouth)

From the beginning she did not want purees at all. I tried the sweet potato and avocado first that everyone recommended. Eventually I found some foods she would eat in puree form (banana and Apple). No blw foods made it into her mouth for the first couple of weeks. She would burst into tears and start wailing often if I put a bit of food on her lips to get her to 'try' it. Eventually she learned to lick the spoon first and then open her mouth if she wanted it. 

Just after she turned 6mos, she started being a bit more accepting and eating more and different foods. She even started putting crackers and such in her mouth. She especially liked cucumbers. We did have an incident tho where she bit off a larger piece of cucumber and almost choked. I was watching her closely to see if she was choking and she did have some distress. Eventually she swallowed it and then promptly projectile vomitted everywhere and then was fine. I didn't realize her gums were strong enough and she was determined enough to actually bite a chunk off. (The blw guide said she would just be gumming and gnawing at the stick but that if she could bite a chunk off to not give it to her and this was the first time I saw she could bite off a whole chunk)

She was still fussy and mealtimes still were tough between trying to get her to try new allergens and making her foods she enjoyed. And she often changed her mind about what she liked and didn't like. (Something she would eat a ton of one day suddenly she'd turn her nose up at the next)

Lately though she's been even more cranky. We've been doing two meals a day, one in the morning and one for dinner. Any little thing and she just melts down. A few things I think I noticed she's unhappy about. She put a couple larger pieces of scrambled egg in her mouth and was having trouble getting them down to a smaller size to swallow. She was getting increasingly frustrated that it was taking so long and started to meltdown. She wailed and in the process swallowed the eggs but almost choked on it. She also HATES when something is stuck on the roof of her mouth. A few times a cracker stuck to the roof of her mouth and she lost it. Just inconsolable. She ate mashed potatoes perfectly fine for a few days. A couple days later, absolutely refused. 

I thought more exposure would see her eating better and slowly getting used to it but it's always a battleground. I try to stay calm and chill and I know it's not her fault but lately I've been thinking this is getting worse and not better. 

Has anyone had similar issues with solids and eating? When did you know you had to call a professional and who did you call? How did they help?

I think both of my girls are cute of course. People are quick to say they look similar but then go on to gush about the older one. My 2nd is also a mix of my husband and I but in the generic shuffle she got mostly different features. I always say I think they're both cute but I've started to get some comments about how my older daughter is really beautiful and should be a kid model. 

The two girls are close in age and I'm afraid one day they will be known as ""the pretty one"" and the ""the smart one"" (or whatever feature). I have a younger brother and I was the smart one... So I know how that feels and it hurts that people make an assessment so clearly about your appearance. It also impacts the expectations that people have for you and for yourself. I don't want my older daughter to have less of an expectation for herself because everyone tells her she's pretty.

Anyone have advice about this kind of situation and how to raise them without creating an unhealthy dynamic?",beyondthebump

1531,Trapped gas? I feel like I'm torturing my 10 month old,"Help. Please. This is rambling, and I apologize..

He's always been a gassy baby. Early on, it was easy to understand because he was born at 35 weeks and his digestive system wasn't happy about it. But he's 10 months old, waking up in the wee hours of the morning with an arched back SCREAMING. We give him 2 doses of gas drops after dinner/before bed, and he's out like a light until maybe 3 AM on good nights. But he hasn't slept through the night once. My husband thought it was because he was nursing during the night, but we've come to realize he's comfort nursing because he's in pain. 

Do we just keep loading him up on gas drops? Is there anything else to do? I'm dead exhausted and haven't slept through the night in over a year now (most nights I might get 4-5 hours uninterrupted...if we're lucky), my husband is exhausted. We're snipping at each other constantly even though we know it isn't either of our fault. I feel like an awful mother, like I'm just letting him be in pain. I know how much trapped gas hurts, and I just want my otherwise sweet, curious baby to have some relief.",beyondthebump

1533,Sleep regression? Teething? A new normal? Does this end?,"My little dude is 5 and a half months. Since three months old, he sort of slept through the night - he would go to bed between 6:30 and 7, wake up around 3 to eat, and then wake up for the morning between 6:30 and 7. Sometimes we’d get him to go even longer stretches. He normally ate between 20-24 ounces during the day, and would have an additional 6 during the night. 

He got sick for the first time andi THINK started teething a little over a week ago, and basically stopped eating during the day, except for 1-2 oz at a time. This meant multiple wake ups at night to get food. Now he’s getting closer to 16 oz during the day, getting closer to 3-4 oz at a time (instead of 5-6) but making it up at night with….you guessed it, multiple wake ups. Now, it’s like 1/4/7 or 12/3/6. I get it - this is part of life, but that first stretch getting truncated has really messed with me and my husband! We also thought we were so close to night weaning, but …. Hahahaha joke’s on me.

Is this the dreaded sleep regression? Or is it because he was sick? I know I’m not comfort feeding him (at least I think) because he’s eating so much less in the day. Is it teething? He’s drooling like crazy everywhere. Or is this my new normal, where my kid prefers to eat at night?

Have you been through this? Please tell me it ends. I would love to get even some semblance of sleep again. Being a working mom is tough!!!!!",beyondthebump

Would it be crazy to make the switch to a toddler bed so he doesn’t dread bedtime as much? I don’t really care if he gets out and plays in his room. He hasn’t tried to get out of his crib yet, but he really likes snuggling up and reading and a bed could make that easier for both of us.

After the initial first week of recovery, I've found that my body is just exhausted all the time. It just feels so weak. I'm exhausted walking up the stairs. When I wake up all my joints (fingers, toes, knees) feel stiff and achey and take quite a while to get going. Holding my head up is tiring.

I'm trying to eat as healthily as possible, and I'm keeping dehydrated. Had a blood test, but here docs only call if Somethings wrong, and they haven't called. I've been out a few times, but it completely wears me out.

Is this just due to lack of sleep and general labour recovery? Are you all going through this too? Any tips or advice?

So I was dreaming of a neverending series of scenarios where he was being too loud and waking the baby. Over and over. I had just gotten her to sleep. I was becoming more and more infuriated. He was the effing worst ever...

Once the eldest is done the dry parent dresses them and gives them a distraction (in our house cocomelon is gold) meanwhile the other parent gets to shower.

1552,How do you know when it’s not normal ?,"I get through my days decent enough. LO is 8 months old. I adore his little face , especially in the morning. We eat breakfast and play with his toys. He naps beautifully , often 2 hours in the morning. I tidy the house , laundry , even catch a nap myself. 

We have swim lesson or a walk in the afternoon, often with some mom friends I met on Peanut. He often goes down for his afternoon nap with zero issue and sleeps at least an hour giving me time to chill and prep dinner. Husband comes come at 4 and spends most today the evening with LO. Big happy family. 

So why at 8 months am I still so exhausted , so lacklustre ? I leave the house with no make up and often baggy ( even dirty clothes ). I can’t bring myself to exercise, something that was once a habit and JOY for me. I hate the extra 25 lbs I have and yet can’t seem to muster even a little willpower when it comes to food. 
Last week I went out to dinner with a friend at a new restaurant ina stylish area of the city and while I was excited to go , I ended up rushing out the door in leggings and oversized tee and Birkenstock’s bcse I couldn’t time getting ready on time. Hair was sorry. My friend bless her heart asked if we should reschedule when she saw me - she said I looked so exhausted she thought I might have the flu or something. 
Most nights I’m in bed by 8pm and don’t stir until 530/600 when LO wakes up ( he sleeps through the night most nights)

Is this motherhood in the first year or is this PPD / PPA?

My 2+ month old baby girl was having a little nap in her Boppy Pillow this afternoon. I was sitting beside her every minute, I looked to make sure she was good. Stepped away to the bathroom not even 3 meters away, and within 5 seconds, I heard the worst noise. The sound that keeps replaying in my head. There was a little *thud* which happens frequently in my home (dog, old house, close neighbors) but instantly her screaming made me know something was wrong. 

I ran to the living room, and found her on the floor. I knew if I started freaking out and crying, she wouldn't calm down. I collected myself, comforted her instantly and thankfully within what felt like hours but was only seconds, she stopped crying and was back to her happy self. She was totally fine, but the mom guilt is real. This is what makes you realize, that it only takes seconds for these things to happen. I keep thinking, what if I sat on the couch for an extra 5 seconds. I would have been there. 

We contacted health professionals and they told us if she is acting normal and happy, just keep an eye on her, which I feel like I'll never take my eye off her again now.",beyondthebump

1557,9mo biting nipple intensely hard. Possibly can’t tolerate any formula at the store. I don’t even know what to do,"She has her two bottom teeth and she’s been growing her top two outer teeth, not the middle ones, but they haven’t broke yet. 

We all had a cold last week and she’s been teething but she’s been eating food and nursing perfectly fine and her appetite has been large for both. Her naps have been a little crazy the past few days and we have let the routine go off a little bit while trying to do chores/errands. 

We bedshare and overall her daytime and night time sleep is pretty good majority of the time. Today I finally got her to sleep and the maintenance man came to fix our kitchen light and she would not go back to sleep so she’s been awake for about 8 hours now. I tried putting her to sleep for hours but she started biting be very hard and it’s just on the verge of breaking skin, she did draw blood two weeks ago (that was the only biting incident until today), and other times she’s biting and pulling away at the same time. I tried rocking her for a few hours too and nothing. 

Just now I was nursing her before we rock her to sleep because she hasn’t had any milk in 3 hours and she bit me very hard again. I’m so scared for the night and if she’s going to keep biting me all night long. I want to give her Tylenol for the teething pain but she bonked her head pretty hard on the crib today and I’m worried that if she had any sort of brain issue from it that the Tylenol would give her a hemorrhage or something. 

We can’t sleep train her tonight because she’s overly tired and possibly in teething pain and we are trying to wean her off reflux med so everything is just a giant mess right now. 

I want to just put her on formula but she has dairy intolerance that we discovered when she was on formula as a newborn and when we switched her to breastmilk she would scream for hours from the dairy in my milk. We tried Alimentum when she was 5.5 months old and it made her reflux worse then too. She also had legume and rice sensitivities in my breastmilk so I’m worried that soy isn’t an option either. 

My husband thinks that she’s just extra biting because she’s so overly tired but I’m scared that this is going to be the new normal. I don’t even want to pump because I don’t respond well to it and nothing comes out. I just want to put her on formula but I don’t think that’s a possibility, although I haven’t done any tests to see if she’s outgrown her issues. I’m terrified for the possible biting all night and I’ve dealt with shallow latch pain and her digging her nails into my nipples and breasts, and I thought that pain was bad, but this is so much worse than either of those things.",beyondthebump

1561,UPDATE to “My Mother possessive of my Baby.” Am I the Asshole?!,"This is another long one, so thanks for reading if you choose to. For context, [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/ombwpr/my_mother_possessive_of_my_baby/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). I’m looking for support, but rest assured I have come to the conclusion that a professional therapist is necessary and am seeking professional assistance in dealing with this. 


So after receiving excellent advice here and being reassured that I am not overreacting and that I should actually address this, I formulated a plan to approach this possessive behaviour and language of my mother towards my new son. 


My plan was to bring it up when it actually happened: gently say how it made me feel and to remind her that my husband and I are the parents etc. (It would depend on what she said in the moment). 


Well, her visit started yesterday with some comments to my son like “you love grandma the best Don’t you?” And, “mom doesn’t know how to do that right” *takes him out of my arms.* (I was just holding him on my lap and had just kissed his cheek, so I’m not sure what “it” was that I was doing wrong.) My husband gave me a huge “what the fuck did she just say to you” look when she said and did this. Oh, and when my son was cooing, she said “oh, you’re telling me about how your mom pinched you this morning.” This is not something that happened. She could have made up anything for him to be saying, but she chose to make up that I intentionally hurt my own baby.


I didn’t say anything. I lost courage. So I gave myself a pep talk and reminded myself of all the reasons there were to say something and promised myself that I would be strong and stand up for myself, and my baby and husband. 


So I did and it did not go well. 


The convo was, 

Mom: “grandma is your favourite person!”

Me: “favourite out of who?”

Mom: “out of everybody”

Me, very very gently: “that’s a bit hurtful to us, remember his parents are important to him and we need to be his favourite people” 

Mom: crumples in to tears and starts bawling. 

“You didn’t think I actually thought that did you? It’s just a joke!” Walks away sobbing. 


I followed her, now feeling HORRIBLE because I’ve made my mother cry, thinking “oh shit this is why I never confront her about how she makes me feel.”


I start fumbling over an apology that I now feel I need to make, I said something like “I know it was a joke, I’m really sorry.” Now I feel like I was wrong to feel the way I do, and my feelings are totally invalid and I should have said nothing at all.


She then says “I don’t know why you always use that tone with me, I guess I need to be EVEN MORE careful around you now.” 


And folks, I have NO CLUE what this means. Like I think I mentioned in my previous post, we’ve had almost no confrontations in my life. I can remember 3. And one of them was a note that she left out for me when coming home as a teenager that said “if you have time to go to your friend’s house, then you have time to wash the windows.” So not actually a confrontation at all. Anyways that’s a different story. 


I said, “I truly didn’t realize I used a tone, and I’m sorry if it came off that way.” 

She’s still crying, tries just waving me away. I clearly now feel that this is entirely my fault and that I’m a horrible person for wanting her to not tell my son that she’s his favourite and better than me at parenting him AND apparently that she feels like she has always had to walk on eggshells around me (??????). You kind people of Reddit don’t know me, but you’ll have to take my word that I am a very agreeable, easy going person to everyone in my life. I am a high school teacher, so I have a lot of patience and exercise it all the time. And I am a people pleaser way more than is healthy to begin with, but I have a fear of doing anything that will displease my parents, so I am always just agreeing with her and trying to say things that I think will make her happy. So this “being careful around me” is out of left field and totally bewilders me in the moment and makes me feel like I must always be difficult to be around or to talk to for her? I don’t know. Anyways..


I say, “I’m really sorry” and for some reason now feel that I have to convince her that I still love her. 


“You know I love you so much. We all do!” Desperately trying to make her feel better and stop crying.


“Well I know your father loves me anyways” (as if I don’t actually love her and also apparently neither does the rest of my family except my dad). 


“You’re my mother, of course I love you. Our relationship is really important to me, and especially since having my own child, I recognize even more how important our relationship is”


She’s unresponsive and inconsolable still. Leaning on the counter with one arm, the other arm across her face.


I ask “can I have a hug?”


She hesitantly agrees and we hug. Then I have to leave to go to the dentist. She and my dad are here visiting for another 24 hours. This is by far the hardest convo I have ever had with my mother. 


There’s been tension in the air, but we’ve been civil and friendly and generally acting like nothing happened. Except what that really means is that I’ve reverted to agreeing with everything she says and trying to specifically say things to please her, and her apparently “being even more careful around me.” 


So I’ve decided I need a therapist to help me navigate our relationship and how it is changing with a new baby. I mean, she definitely needs a therapist too, but if she reacted to me telling her that something she said was a bit hurtful by bawling and invalidating my feelings, then me suggesting that she might need a therapist would probably be relationship ending.",beyondthebump

I then naturally fell pregnant with second son when my first was just 3 months old. It was insane but we were so happy. 

To put things bluntly, my first pregnancy was a nightmare. It was totally riddled by unfortunate events that never ended. 
When I was 20 weeks pregnant, a very incompetent doctor checked my cervix as I was complaining of minor cramping. He told me that my cervix was dilated to 2cm and I’d soon lose our precious IVF baby. For 2 hours my husband and I were left sobbing in a hospital room alone, we called our entire family to tell them that baby boy was going to die in the night, until another doctor finally came in to check me over and confirmed my cervix was not open and the prior doctor had gotten it wrong. He even got another doctor to check me who agreed that my cervix was closed and I wasn’t at risk of miscarriage. It was devastating. After our son was born, I made a complaint about this but was told that there was nothing the hospital could do about it upon reviewing my complaint. 

A few weeks after this, I began noticing my son barely moved at all when inside of me. I was a first time mum but I knew it still wasn’t right. He would move maybe twice a day throughout my ENTIRE pregnancy. Some days not at all. I frequently admitted myself to the birthing unit for assessment due to reduced movements. 
One day, on my fifth admission, a midwife reported me to child protective services as she looked through my files and saw I had anxiety and depression. 
When the social worker dealing with the case came to speak to my husband and I, she told us that the midwife had reported us as she felt I was a risk to my unborn baby and was ‘lying’ about the reduced movements for attention. 
I had never done anything to raise suspicion at all. I told these health care professionals nothing but the truth. 

The CPS case amounted to nothing at all because the social worker determined the midwife was wrong for ever referring us in the first place. The midwife was totally slammed by CPS who said she had likely made my mental illness worse with her report. The midwife then dropped me from her case load and said she didn’t want to deal with me any more. I can only figure this is because she was in trouble for making the unwarranted report in the first place therefore had to drop me as a patient. 

When our son was born, it was found he had a really short cord that was preventing him from moving. It could’ve totally snapped at any given point and killed him. My gut instinct was right. I hadn’t once ‘lied’ about any of it. He was born at 36 weeks due to the repeated reduced movements and gestational diabetes that in the end was insulin controlled. 

Ever since the CPS report I’ve doubted my ability to be a mother to both of my boys. I am constantly insecure and paranoid that CPS will come back and I will be accused of neglecting my babies. It has become a real problem now and I am at the point where I totally break down if my eldest son (who is constantly running and walking nowadays!) bumps and bruises his head as I believe someone will report me and my kids will be taken away.
I was never like this before the midwifes report. It hasn’t even seemed to ease my anxieties that CPS found us to be excellent parents. I almost feel that I’ve developed PTSD due to this treatment in my first pregnancy. 

My pregnancy with second son was perfect and text book (however I did develop diabetes again) he moved CONSTANTLY And I didn’t have a single episode of reduced movements with him. He was induced at 38 weeks due to my diabetes but other than that, the pregnancy was a dream. It made me feel horrendously sad however over my prior pregnancy with first son because it was so evident and clear that the health care professionals that were meant to be ‘caring’ for me didn’t believe a word I said about my worries with first son barely moving and such. To the point one of them even reported me to CPS. They even made me doubt myself as I would think I was IMAGINING not being able to feel my baby move. I know now for a fact this wasn’t the case. He definitely was not moving. 

Is there any way I can get over this one day? Has anyone else here experienced anything similar? Some days, like today, I just feel so upset over it and angry too that absolutely nothing seemed to be done about these failings. 

Thank you.",beyondthebump
1564,RSV - experience,"11 month old had fever and vomiting, four days later (after what we thought was stomach virus) has nasty cough/mucus. Tests positive for RSV. fever finally goes away on day 6.

I briefly had her watch him at her home for a few hours while we were moving and had loud contractors over in the new house, and she would ask me if I wanted LO to stay the night, or when I would pick him up she would say “I don’t want him to go”.

1571,How to get through this?,"Hi all, just looking for encouragement. My LO is 13 weeks and sick - I don’t want to get into it but he’s on antibiotics and when he’s done will have to get an ultrasound with the possibility of surgery (depending on the results). The antibiotics make his stomach hurt and it’s so hard for me to watch him in pain. I try to do everything I can to relieve him but his ped said it will likely continue to be uncomfortable and basically all I can do is try to help alleviate some of the discomfort. I’m also super anxious about the ultrasound results and the fact that we have to wait until August 1 when he’s done with the antibiotics is making it worse. 

He was already not sleeping through the night but now he’s waking every 2 hours in pain. The last two weeks I have developed insomnia - all day long I obsess about sleep, knowing I won’t be able to go to sleep for my “shift” which ends up being a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I’m exclusively pumping but I have DMER so I get emotional during let downs AND I’m an overproducer, so I’ve been trying to wean but it’s taking forever (dropping pumps has actually made me produce more milk). 

I also lost my grandma, who adopted me at birth, when my LO was 2 weeks old and I’ve been dealing with intense grief since then. 

I’m in therapy for ppd/ppa, just got started back on Zoloft which I took before I was pregnant, and am trying to practice good sleep hygiene. I know I’m basically doing all I can but it’s sooo hard some days. What can I tell myself to get through this time?",beyondthebump

1573,I finally reached out for help today. TW - PPD,"Wow. Where do I start?


TW - postnatal depression, suicidal thoughts 



I had my 2nd daughter in March of this year so she's nearly 5 months old now. She is the happiest, cutest, baby and she's so chill. My oldest daughter is 2.5 years old, and she's so bright and kind and wonderful.



So I couldn't believe that despite having these amazing babes, the most supportive husband, and a great family around me, my mood has been so low for weeks (if not months). I had a feeling that this wasn't just ""baby blues"" like my doctor said it could have been back at my 6 week checkup. I've been feeling like a burden and a failure. I didn't enjoy doing much, and I feel numb almost all the time. It all came to a head on Saturday when I woke up in the morning and I just wanted to end it all. I spent hours and hours thinking of how to end it, how I could do it without anyone having to clear up my mess, how I could do it without someone I know finding me. 

I couldn't bare the thought of leaving my children motherless though, that's the one thing that stopped me from doing anything.


I had a really honest conversation with my husband and I think he finally understood the gravity of the situation. He suggested we go to counselling together because he thought he'd done something to make me feel like this :( I've reassured him that it's not his fault, it's my brain being fucky with me. It's so hard to admit how bad things were.


Anyways so I didn't expect much when filling out the online appointment form for my GP, but I got a call back within a few hours of requesting an appointment and my doctor prescribed me medication immediately. She was so kind and understanding and she is gonna check on me in a couple of weeks. Husband went to pick up the pills after work and I've already taken the first one. Baby steps. Hope in a few weeks I'll be feeling more like myself.

1576,Feeling very guilty over holding my 4.5 mo for naps - feel like I'm setting her up for failure. Advice?,"First and foremost, before it's mentioned in the comments: Yes, I did/do have PPD and I'm in treatment and on medication. 

A little background: I'm a FTM. I'm sure after this post that will be very obvious :) My daughter is 4.5 months old. I am a teacher and she was born in March, so I've been on mat leave since I had her. The only people that have ever watched her for an extended period of time are me, my husband, and my mom. She has napped in our home only during this time.

My daughter is not a ""bad"" sleeper. I'd say she's pretty average for her age. Like most other 4-5 month olds, she's currently in the phase of very short naps. I rock her mostly to sleep for naps and night sleep. She sleeps okay/fine at night. However, if I put her in her crib after I rock her to sleep for a nap, she will sleep on average 25 minutes and then be wide awake and happy. I've never, ever gotten more than 35 minutes in the crib for a nap. Due to her needing 2.5 to 3 hours of daytime sleep (we have experimented and this is what works best for us), trying to put her down in the crib for every nap is annoying and exhausting, and leaves us feeling trapped in the house. Therefore, I or my husband hold her for most naps so we can do 3-4 longer naps instead instead of literally 6 very short nap times. 

That said, I feel intensely guilty about this, for 2 main reasons:  
1. Many people in my life are telling me this is a bad habit that will cause her to never nap independently...that she will always prefer sleeping on us, or at least for a long time. My mom says this, my MIL says this, posts on baby subs say this, and most importantly, my pediatrician told me this. She says I should continue to put her down in the crib for every nap. I feel like I HAVE to sleep train my LO to fall asleep on her own from completely awake (fucking drowsy but awake......). This sometimes works for us at night. It has NEVER worked for naps. I worry I'm letting her down by creating bad daytime sleep habits. 

2. She is going to daycare next month. This is unavoidable, my husband and I both have to work. I feel like I'm setting up my poor daughter for failure because they obviously will not hold her for her naps. They will set her in the Pack n Play and expect her to sleep. I worry she's in for a world of confusion when this happens because we don't practice it enough at home. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting this - I suppose reassurance and support!? Can anyone help? Am I being irrational and not giving my daughter enough credit? Will this crap nap issue go away on its own or do I need to train her...? Very lost with this!!",beyondthebump

So, I’m planning on just paying out of pocket for his first 2-3 appointments in that first month. Does anyone know how much a typical newborn appointment costs?

1594,Is daycare overfeeding?,"Sorry if this is a stupid question.

My almost 4 month old started daycare last week. Before starting daycare, she was mostly breastfed. We would supplement about 4-6 ounces of formula a day if she still acted hungry. Even when drinking pumped milk, a 4 oz bottle was about the most she drank, sometimes a 5 oz bottle, but there was about 3-4 hours between feedings.

At daycare, she drinks 18 oz a day, fed 6 oz every two hours. She’s only there from 7am to 2pm. Today they made her an 8 oz bottle an hour after drop off! 

This just seems like a crazy amount to me. But, she does drink all of the milk. Is she being over fed? If they drink the milk, are they hungry for it, if that makes sense?

1597,Daycare not properly defrosting breast milk,"TLDR: Daycare center is letting breast milk thaw at room temperature (and some other questionable practices). Am I over-reacting?

I bring my five-month-old daughter’s breast milk in to daycare frozen and in a small lunchbox cooler. I bring enough for about a week.

My husband typically drops the kids off, so he brought in the cooler of milk around 8PM. When I picked up the kids at 3PM, the daycare teachers handed me back the cooler, and I noticed the entire ziplock bag of milk bags just sitting on a table. They didn’t look completely defrosted, so I assumed they left them in the cooler all day. Was fuming at first, but I took some time to decompress and didn’t end up say anything.

One or two days later, there was a completely defrosted, room temperature bag of her milk sitting on the counter when I picked her up. It wouldn’t have been time for her to eat again for another hour, so I’m not really sure why it was out… It was either thrown away or put back in the fridge, and both options make me pretty angry.

I’ve also been offered bottles to take home and finish feeding to her 2+ hours after she started drinking them. On multiple occasions I’ve also questioned why she was out of milk already when I know I brought enough for a certain period of time. 

Part of me doesn’t want to say anything because I don’t want to be “that mom”, and I would like to think a daycare facility would be following the proper guidelines. Then another part of me is genuinely concerned my daughter is being fed gross milk with bacteria in it or that the daycare is wasting her breast milk.

Prior to giving birth or even getting pregnant, all we hear from other people is how exhausting it is, the lack of sleep, how breastfeeding is a pain etc, but I have never heard anyone mention the hair loss?? and it apparently happens to 90% of people in post partum?? I guess it's something super embarrassing to talk about, no one wants to announce to the world they are going bald, but had I'd known this were a thing, I could have mentally prepared myself for it. Because when my hair started falling off, the thought of being bald at my age and how ugly I was going to look, and how wigs are fucking expensive (lol) was overwhelming. Thank goodness for this subreddit and the amount of hair loss posts on here, I immediately found out that it was completely normal, that it was going to grow back and more importantly, that I am not alone in this. 

In response to this, I made a post on FB telling everyone how much hair I was losing and my feelings about it. It wasn't at all easy to talk about, but in the end I am glad I did because I received a lot of PMs afterwards from a few currently pregnant friends asking me if they should expect hair loss too. It helped also that a lot of my momma friends responded to the said post saying how normal it was, some gave tips on how to manage, while some shared their experience with it as well. I just feel like this is something people need to know in advance so they don't add it to the things they need to stress  about when it happens.

I just think as an adult there's only so much playing I can do but then I get mum guilt if I try to watch TV or play on computer games for a bit, basically any adult type of thing that is solely for me whilst he is still awake.

I think I'm feeling a bit guilty that he is stuck in a situation where going outside is limited and we've barely been able to see anyone or do anything due to covid and cancer.",beyondthebump
1606,20 month old played quietly in her crib until she fell asleep,"I always read about kids having quiet time before bed… playing with toys or reading. As a first time parent, I wondered when my fussy baby would chill out.

But not tonight! Tonight about 15 minutes after we left her room, I checked the monitor and saw her playing quietly with her stuffed animal. Eventually she rolled over and fell asleep. I’m elated! Just had to share.",beyondthebump

1608,Am I selfish?,"Am I selfish for asking my husband for help with our 7 week old I'm the middle of the night, even if it is just for a diaper change? Our baby is exclusively breast fed, and he works out side of the home while I am a SAHM to our newborn and 5 yo. His stance is that since I am going to get up to feed her anyway, there is no point in him waking up to change a diaper because it would take him an hour or so to fall back asleep. He thinks it is selfish of me to want him to possibly lose out on sleep since I will be getting up anyway. It is not that I want him to suffer or lose out on sleep, I would just appreciate all the sleep I could get, even if it were an extra 5 minutes while he changed the diaper or tried to soothe her. He thinks since I am suffering, that I want the same for him. I get that he has to work the next day. So maybe I am selfish for requesting help that would literally take me a few minutes to do myself if it meant he'd have a hard time falling back asleep and risking his performance at work. My husband said he'd never ask that of me if he was in my shoes. He was definitely more hands on at night with our first, but that was mainly because we were first time parents and didn't know what we were doing and thought every noise our baby made during the night was him dying.  Am I in the wrong here? What are the arrangements with your SO? I need a little perspective because I am having a hard time seeing his on this one.",beyondthebump

1610,Family coming to visit amid Delta Variant outbreak,"Background: I was vaccinated in my 2nd trimester, now my baby is 3 weeks old and I’m pumping and feeding 50/50 breast milk and formula from a bottle. 

I have family coming to visit from multiple states including one with a low vaccination rate. Everyone who is invited has been vaccinated but there are a couple people who have been in very close quarters with an anti vaxx family member. The anti vaxxer has been told she’s not going to be able to see the baby but everyone is concerned about the baby’s safety now. 

We have family both flying and driving in. We asked everyone to wear a mask in any public setting this week in preparation for being the safest as we can around baby, but didn’t catch the people who were with the anti vaxxer in time. They are coming down in just 3 days to visit. 

My question is, how concerned should we be? Should we un invite everyone? In just the past couple of days the Delta variant was gotten worse and there’s no telling what the rest of the week will bring. 

If we do allow visitors we will be congregating outside, requiring everyone to wash hands/use hand sanitizer properly and wear a mask while holding the baby. Also no kisses, obviously. 

I need some input from anyone in a similar situation. Studies show that my baby should have antibodies from my vaccine, and with vaccinated people + masks am I overreacting? Is he going to be ok?",beyondthebump

1614,Questions in reflux,"My second baby is just over 7 months old. We breastfed exclusively for 5 months, combo fed until 6 months, and then went to formula when my supply tanked. 

My baby's weight started in the 50th percentile at birth and dropped slowly to the mid 40s. At the 6th month mark it dropped to the 18th percentile but also correlated to when we started formula and cut out breastmilk.

He spits up, frequently. But he is the happiest kid ever. He rarely cries, he does not seem uncomfortable, he sleeps amazing (12 hours at night plus 3 naps every day), he does great with bottles and baby purees (fruits, veggies, yogurt, oatmeal, etc) His doctors wanted to start him on reflux meds at 6 months due to his percentile drop and spitting up. I am not thrilled with the idea and asked for other options. We started formula with added rice starch and increased his baby foods. He started taking 2 more bottles a day and more ""solids"". Today we followed up and he is in the 24th percentile for weight. The doctor is still concerned and pushed medication despite my concerns and discussion on inconsistent information (2 doctors in the practice have seen him for this and give me different info, and the research I have read doesn't really agree with what they say). They have been open to my not wanting him to be on meds and are willing to give us more time. But I still kind of feel like they were judging my wanting to try more conservative measures. I am not opposed to meds but also have read that 12 months is the ""spit up"" bench mark but they pushed hard that it is 6 months. They pushed hard that this is not normal and he is not progressing but he only has a few symptoms of reflux and was in a good percentile until 6 months and has been making a comeback.

I am at a loss. My instinct is to give it more time, to increase his solid food diet and add oatmeal or rice cereal to his bottles and change our lifestyle a bit to see if that helps. Everything I have read said most kids grow out of this and I know some medications for reflux have been recalled. My mother who is a nurse completely agrees, my husband agrees, our nanny thinks the doctor is nuts because my son is so healthy looking. I hone a try feel like if I didn't know the number of his percentile I wouldn't be worried. If the doctors weren't concerned, I would not be slightly concerned. But because they are pushing for meds it makes me nervous...

For now, I am sticking with my instincts and we are going to focus on higher calorie healthy foods to fill him along with formula bottles with added rice/oatmeal. I have a follow up in a month.

1615,"For those with a challenging, highly sensitive newborn, hope from the other side!!","My baby girl HATED the 4th trimester. She was such an unhappy baby. It almost killed me, as a FTM who'd been dreaming of this time of my life for 20 + yrs. LO cried (screamed) loudly, painfully, relentlessly for 4 months. Refused to breastfeed, breaking my heart. Hated skin 2 skin. I believed she didn't want me, that I was failing to her. Was it reflux? Colic? Did I give birth to a total jerk? All this contributing to my inability to bond with her. If I heard the phrase ""it gets better"" one more time I would have headbutt someone. The stark contrast between how I pictured life with a newborn to how it went was an extremely disappointing comedown. I never thought I'd see the light but here I am with my loving, smiling, giggling, squishy, happy 6 month old, planning number 2.

I just remember looking for anecdotes that gave me hope my newborn wouldn't always despise existence. That just because I had a difficult newborn, didn't mean I'd created a terrible person. That just because my self-preservation instincts prevented me from being able to bond with her, didn't mean our love wouldn't blossom. If you're in the trenches of the 4th trimester - it's so so hard. I see you, I acknowledge that it's hell and I'm sending you strength. I know you don't want to hear that it gets better coz each day seems harder than the day before. For me, hearing that it's definitely enjoyable by 6m almost sent me over the edge when I didn't know if I could get through 1 more day.

A mom gave me a lightbulb moment the other day but I need some help. 

I do hearing screenings on newborns, which is a pretty cool job but can be a pain because we need baby to stay sleepy and as still as possible for up to 15 minutes. One barrier is that the gel we use is on the colder side, as well as our baby wipes are cold. A mom mentioned to me that wipe warmers exist, which could make everyone’s experience overall better. 

The only trouble is it seems most wipe warmers are plug in. Has anyone found one that is battery operated? Or if you heat the wipes completely then unplug, is the unit insulated enough to stay warm for a little while? I saw some that looked big enough to heat a few swaddle blankets, my little gel and some wipes. Gosh, that would be a dream :)

So my issue is that the rest of the pack n play is fine, but the mat is no longer useable. I emailed Graco to ask about purchasing another, but of course they aren’t available.

1628,Birth to 3/Early intervention because 9 month old isn’t babbling - anyone else have any experience? Very worried.,"Hi everyone. My son just turned 9 months old last week and still isn’t babbling, so I’m one worried mom. He is making noises, but it’s mostly ahhhhhs and grrrs. He will blow raspberries occasionally, but no “ma” “ba” “da” etc and he’s certainly not stringing then together to make noises like mamamamamma etc. He was on the later side for his gross motor skills, but is just about all caught up. He’s very focused on crawling and trying to pull to stand now. I’m hoping he is focusing his energy on his motor skills and that’s why his babbling is lacking. His fine motor has always been good, if not advanced. 

We had our 9 month well visit today, and I brought up the lack of babbling to the pediatrician. She said she wasn’t concerned, and they usually don’t get concerned until 1 year, but she referred us to birth to 3. I called the program to schedule an assessment, and they did the intake and will be getting back to me. They did mention it wouldn’t be in person because of Covid. After the assessment, they will let me know if he needs early intervention services or not. 

Part of me feels it’s a little early to get an assessment for speech (I personally was going to wait until 1 year to ask), but google keeps telling me that the lack of babbling could be a huge indicator of developmental delays so I am worried and would want to get my son whatever help he could need. I also don’t really know how well a virtual assessment is going to go over either.. I don’t know how engaged he is going to be with the providers over a computer screen. I’m scared it won’t be accurate and might pick up other “red flags” that may or may not be present. 

So - any other BTDT parents that have been in similar situations? What were your outcomes? Did early intervention help for speech at 9 months? Did your kids eventually catch up with babbling or speech? Please let me know any stories or advice you have for me. Thank you!",beyondthebump
1629,2.5 month old with 11 days of diarrhea now…,"My LO had a severe tongue tie that we had revised on Tuesday the 13th at a pediatric dentist. Friday the 16th he started having diarrhea and a few days after that seemed to have a fever (our forehead thermometer is all over the place from normal to 100.5, but the few rectal temps I took were 99.4-99.7) he also had a day where I was vomiting, which seemed to be the worst day and he has since stopped. I’ve kept our pediatrician in the loop consistently from the beginning (I’m probably driving him crazy..) and he just keeps saying he probably picked up a stomach bug at the dentist and to just wait it out, that it could take 2 weeks or so.

Should I bring him in and insist on tests?? Do they do any tests? Is there anything to help with his diarrhea?

1641,Husband refuses to consider soy formula,"My six-week-old son has had a pretty bad case of silent reflux since day one. He doesn't just cry he howls. Legit purple-faced howls. The doctor put him on Pepcid when he was two weeks and it works a bit. Apparently, it is weight-based so we've upped it before when he gained some weight. 

We have tried Similac Pro Advance formula, Pro sensitive and Alimentum and none of them do anything significant. He is still fussy and cries a lot. We even tried breast milk, which had the worst reaction. So we aren't sure if it is a true dairy allergy or a lactose sensitivity, considering he is better on the Similac Pro Sensitive than he was on breast milk.

The one formula my husband refuses to consider is Soy. I know this is hotly debated but I feel like I have a good reason to make the switch. 

My MIL said my husband had colic and the only thing that helped him was switching to soy. My twin sister and I were both gassy, reflux babies that had to be on goat's milk/soy formula. My twin sister's son had reflux and was even on Zantac. My sister said the only thing that made a difference was switching to Soy. And that both of her kids did better on Soy.

I am okay with mitigating his reflux with Pepcid but he's been getting worse and worse and this afternoon/evening is really bad again. We already feed him upright, hold him upright for 30 minutes after each meal, burp after every ounce.  We give him probiotics in the morning, gas drops before each meal, gripe water if he is inconsolable. Nothing really works long-term.

My husband's last name is long, as is my maiden name, so hyphenating would have been really awkward. So my maiden name was tossed and my daughter got my husband's name. 

Now that my daughter is born, I'm more and more feeling like my old identity is slipping away into nothingness. I wish I'd worked my last name into hers so that it can survive another generation.

Still, I keep catching myself thinking about trying to rename my daughter so that I put my maiden name in as a second middle name for her. It'd basically be silent and not used except on forms, but it would be significant to me.

1645,Six months and everything got so much harder!,"I am kind of an accidental mom… I was a fencesitter, and then I got pregnant. During my pregnancy I was really depressed because I was afraid of the chaos that is involved with being a mom. The worn out feeling, the lack of freedom. 

I had my baby in January and thought I had dodged a bullet. Broken sleep for the first two months, but she was fairly predictable and only cried when she was hungry. Then she started sleeping through the night without any issues. Up until six months, she has been a pretty easy baby, and able to able to entertain herself for long periods of time. I had been able to set her down for maybe a half hour at a time or 45 minutes at a time and she’s just play. 

So, I thought, this mom thing isn’t that bad. But lately I am starting to experience the feelings I was afraid of.

Now that she is over six months, I’m starting to see why everyone thinks parenting is so hard. It’s just exhausting. She starting to become more mobile, requiring more attention, and she starting to become a hell of a lot more needy. Some days she’s still good independently, but other days she whines and cries when I put her down to do anything. She has moved down from four naps a day to two naps a day, so gradually, I’ve had less than less breaks. I’m honestly feeling so tired and burned out. And the worrisome thing for me is, she is still kind of a potato… She’s not even crawling yet... and my entire family thinks she’s easy.

**And before anyone comes at me for putting cereal in his bottles, he's the baby of 4. My oldest had to have cereal in her bottle for reflux and aspiration, and my second child had to have some in his bottle too cus he had reflux when he was a baby real bad and he is currently taking pepcid as well** 
I'm just at a loss as to what else I can do for him before his appointment in September.

1653,Postpartum rash (pupps),"I was diagnosed with Pupps which is basically a rash that occurs during pregnancy and only improves once delivery of the baby takes place. There are some people who get it postpartum too. Well… I’m one of the lucky ones that got it postpartum. There’s no real cause besides maybe hormones, stress/anxiety on the body from going through labor and delivery, and skin stretching from being pregnant. My rash was from my neck to my toes and was so bad I was scratching my skin open daily and crying because I was so uncomfortable and felt like I couldn’t take care of my newborn. From my research online, it usually goes away on its own anywhere from 2-6weeks. Mine went away mostly at about 4-5 weeks. I’m at almost 7 weeks now and I think it’s coming back, which I didn’t think it would. Has anyone here had this type of rash and did yours come back? If so, did it come back at the same level of misery or was it less severe? I made an appointment with a dermatologist and can’t be seen until next week. I’m so anxious that this rash will come back just as severe and I can’t go through that again. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Basically, I’m looking for reassurance from someone whose gone through this that it won’t be as bad as the first round of it. Thank you in advance.",beyondthebump

1657,Visitors,"My family is a bit overbearing of the first grandchild. For some reason my brother has decided he wants to take a very active role in the baby’s life which is great, but it feels pushy. He has made comments about wanting to “mold” our child to become a prodigy of his interests (music). Music is great but the idea of anyone “molding” my kid is cringey. Anyways, we have been home from the hospital for a week, and have tried to make an effort to allow both families to see the baby once per week. I sent my family a text saying we were going to bring the baby to another family members house Thursday if they wanted to join (thinking that would be there baby time for this week). My family responded they couldn’t make Thursday. My mom said she was available to come help Friday if need be. I said I will let you know. My brother then responded “good idea we will go friday.” And it made me instantly angry. We are working on getting this baby on a sleep/wake/feed cycle, he is cluster feeding, and there are many people who want to meet him. So that comment really didn’t sit with me - I offered an opportunity that worked for our schedule and felt like I was then pushed into a direction that worked for them (more so my brother). I responded that we are unavailable because we have plans already Friday so they should try to make Thursday because it works best for us. Am I overreacting here?",beyondthebump

I’m already aware that this is a normal postpartum thing.  But the weirder thing is that onions suddenly smell that same kind of gross to me.  And it’s sad because I used to really love onions and they’re in basically everything I like to cook.  But now anything that contains onions, raw, cooked, white, sweet, red, any kind, smells so off putting to me and ruins the taste of the dish.

1660,Am I overreacting? And what can I do to strengthen my marriage?,"Okay, okay… so I already pretty much know that I overreacted but I feel hurt and I still feel a little jealous. So, my husband and I have been married for about four years now and we just had our first baby five months ago. My postpartum experience was a little rough as I had PPD and PPA. However, I got on Zoloft and feel so much better. It also didn’t help that my hubby worked 14 hour days as he is in the Navy. 

Anyways, we just started to find our groove again. But, our “intimate” life has kind of suffered since having the baby. I have been extremely happy insecure with my body because even though I lost pretty much all the weight, nothing really looks the same. My boobs are saggy, my stomach has a little ledge (from my c section), and I’m starting to lose a little hair. It’s just been really, really rough on my self-esteem. I obviously love my baby though and I would never take back that I had him. I love him so much. 

Anyways, the other night my husband fell asleep and I was wide awake. I ended up (bad, I know) going through his phone. I only did that because he has photos of our baby from when he was a newborn that I wanted to see and send to myself. I ended up going on his Instagram and to his saved photos . I was just being nosy, not really expecting much. I found about ten saved photos of an Instagram model that has a big butt. Like really big butt and a small waist. She was really pretty. And she was in a tiny little thing bathing suit or lingerie (I couldn’t tell). I kind of felt hurt. Only because I don’t have a big butt like that, and even though I’m small and thin, I have parts of my body that just doesn’t look like it did before I got pregnant. I also went to his recent links and he went on that models link and it was linked to a bunch of different tabs like her social media pages, and unfortunately there was a tab to her only fans account. I know that costs money so I don’t think he clicked on that but I felt soo hurt anyways. 

Now I feel like any ounce of confidence I had left is just destroyed. Like completely destroyed. 

He apologized and said it was disrespectful and that he was wrong. He told me all this stuff that he feels like a dirt bag. I told him that it’s okay, that I know it’s normal to look but I just feel sad and honestly, you guys, I don’t think I lm gonna be able to have sex again for a while. Or if I do all I’m gonna think about is the fact that I don’t look the way he would probably want me to.

1663,Postpartum Bathroom Basket - C Section,"Hi all. I am scheduled for a C section next week, and am going to be setting up my postpartum ""bathroom basket"" soon.

Diapers  
Peri bottle (I've been told its super nice to just keep things feeling clean even without the vaginal recovery)  
Tucks  
""Padsicles"" that I will keep in the freezer

Now, my pregnancies and right up to birth were pretty awful… but maybe I was just given a break after all that? I had preeclampsia with the first. I delivered at 34 weeks and I was hospitalized for four days. Baby was in the NICU for 10 days and born at 4 lbs 4 oz. 

The second baby I delivered at 35 weeks due to gestational hypertension. I was in the hospital for nine days; luckily baby did not have to go to NICU. My second was 5 lbs 1 oz.

My 7 month old’s unofficial “lullaby” is ‘Work Song’ by Hozier. No special meaning - I was just rocking her one night when she was about a month old and was thinking of songs I knew all the words to. That was the first one that came to mind and it seemed to soothe her so I just went with it. I’ve continued singing it ever since as part of her bedtime routine and now (even for naps) I hardly get to the second verse and she’s out 😆

1669,AS Arthritis flare up and pregnant,"Hello. I have been diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis) for over 10 years. I have been on Humira which has helped manage my pain. When I get flare ups my doctor prescribes me either prednisone or indocin which helps after a few days. I came off humira in June because we wanted to try to get pregnant. Found out that I am about 5 weeks pregnant and for the past two weeks I have been in one of my worst flares ever. I have horrible pain in my buttocks, hips and lower back. I can barely walk, can’t sleep and can’t do household chores. Laying down is the absolute worst so I dread going to sleep. I’ve changed my diet (trying gluten free), tried sleeping with no pillow, took tylenol. My doctor knows I am pregnant and told me to take ibuprofen which I did for a little but I’m so scared of taking this medication. I have read a lot of mixed reviews about pregnancy and this medication. I am so inflamed and nothing I’m doing is taking the inflammation down.    
   
Has anyone been through a situation like this and if so what helped with your inflammation? Bring pregnant makes this 10x more complicated and scary. I don’t want to take any medicine but I can’t go on like this as I know I will end up in the hospital. Thanks in advance!",beyondthebump

So I never really worried too much about how our nap schedule went, but my MIL visited recently and lightly hinted that he sleeps so much or has too many naps. Nothing malicious at all (I get along with her great), but she has had 6 kids so I’m starting to wonder.

My baby (13 weeks) has only ever napped 20-30 mins at a time with maybe a 45 min nap once a day. He has an average wake window of 1.5 hours sometimes 2 hours. So this means we’re putting him to nap 7-8 times a day. And he’s still only equals about 11-13 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. 

I looked up what Mr. Google suggests and it’s 3-4 naps a day for his age! However, they seem to assume he’s napping 1.5-2 hours at a time. 

My pediatrician knows about his short naps and aren’t worried because he sleeps through the night or only wakes up once on occasion.

1692,MIL regularly overfeeds baby (and is surprised when he spits up),"My in laws live like 10 minutes away, having moved here late in my pregnancy to be closer to their grandbaby. As such, we try to hand baby off for one afternoon per weekend, so we can get some chores done and alone time. Baby is 3 months old.

My MIL just can't seem to get a few things through her head. First, she and FIL don't put baby down when he's visiting. At all. This was fine for the first two months, but baby is very active (rolled back to front starting at 3 months 2 days) and gets hella frustrated if he can't move. I'm not sure why I bothered getting a baby gym specifically for their place because they never put him in it. At daycare the baby gym is his favorite. (In laws don't want to be full time daycare which is understandable).

Second, and related, MIL assumes that any time he's fussy he wants food. And she always makes a full bottle. Right now he can take up to about 4-5 ounces comfortably, so I recommended 3-4 per bottle (I have a small milk supply and can hold about 2 ounces and immediately give a 3 ounce bottle after nursing with no issues other than baby not wanting to finish last bit of bottle). He eats every 2-3 hours during the day.

When she handed him back to me tonight, he was in different clothes. Why? At 5:45 he was given a 4 ounce bottle. She decided he was still hungry because he was fussy, and rather than do what I told her (""he is starting to get fussy if he's being held too long. If he's fed and dry, try putting him down for a bit""), nope. Clearly couldn't be that he doesn't want to be held. Must be hungry!

Another 4 ounces got stuffed into that kid at 6:15, and a few moments later both MIL and baby were covered in projectile vomit.

Well maybe next time she will listen. Until then, I guess I'm doing laundry again.

For the record, I love my in-laws, but God almighty I know now why my husband was such a chunky baby. He wasn't born that way, he was force fed that way. I'm pretty careful about how much formula I give because my supply needs all the help it can get, and he gets wildly lower amounts with me and even daycare. Normal day for him is 17 ounces of formula. Today tipped the scales at 23.",beyondthebump

1696,Trouble with sleep and desperate for help,"Coming here for support and advice because I’m struggling with sleep with my 6 week newborn… shocker.

From the day he was born, my little guy will only sleep while being held. Our first night with him, I literally only got 30 minutes of sleep. He wailed as soon as he was placed in the bassinet every time. I didn’t know this could be normal and in my post birth shock and adjustment, as well as being a FTM, I had no idea what I was in for. 

Since being more overall adjusted to being a FTM this many weeks later, I’m still unsettled and stressed about sleep. I started cosleeping with him 2 weeks ago in our bed out of necessity of my sanity in needing sleep. I support safe cosleeping and have done decent research in my desperate attempts to find a solution and stay awake in the middle of the night. But I don’t feel cosleeping works for me. I’m a deep sleeper and have always required a decent amount of quality sleep to function well. I’m sad to admit that I don’t always immediately hear his cry or grunt right away, it usually takes a minute or two before I wake up and realize. I tend to him in such a sleepy state, I just don’t feel safe. I wish so badly he would take to a safe sleep surface even for 1-2 hours at a time. Most naps are contact naps, I’ve been able to do a few supervised naps in his dockatot if the situation is right. 

I feel like I’ve tried so much. At the start, my husband and I rotated every 2 hours holding him, but we couldn’t keep this up due to our exhaustion and basically falling asleep holding him. I’ve taken on nights 100% because my husband is back at work - I don’t mind this because he needs sleep and I’m EBF and need to be awake by with him regardless. We have a bedside bassinet in our bedroom and crib in his nursery. He hates the bassinet, seems to tolerate the crib but only got him to sleep in it for 30 minutes so far. He seems to hate swaddles, but has a strong startle reflex. We’ve tried halo with arms in and out, woombie, and love to dream. He fusses in all of them. We have a hatch sound machine, doesn’t seem to have made A difference. Tried heating the bassinet and crib to no avail also. 

What I have noticed - when placed on his back for sleep, he spits up and this can be a decent while after eating. This concerns me. In my bed, I cuddle curl him and he winds up on his side which seems to suit him best. I give gerber soothe drops because he spits up a lot and I have a concern for reflux. The more he grows and becomes alert, the more sensitive he becomes. I can rock or bounce him to a deep sleep, but as soon as he is transferred out of my arms, he stirs and wakes and cries until I pick him up. 

If you’ve made it this long, I appreciate it. I feel so alone and it’s amplified at night time. I desperately want to do right by my baby and not put him in harms way.",beyondthebump
1697,Alternatives to crib bumpers?," My rapidly-enlarging 4 month old is probably going to outgrow his bassinet sooner rather than later, so while we're hoping to keep him in our bedroom at night until six months, we've been letting him spend some time in his crib during the day so that it's not such an abrupt transition.

Kiddo is an early wriggler, though, so he keeps getting an arm or a leg through the slats of the crib and freaking himself out until rescued.    I know he'll eventually learn he can pull whatever appendage is stuck back in, but in the meantime I'm reeeeally not liking the idea of leaving him in the crib overnight when he spends most of it rolling and sleep-crawling endlessly in his bassinet as it is.  So now that crib bumpers are no longer considered safe for sleep, what do people use as alternatives?   Do I just go with it and get my hands on bumpers while I can?    I honestly don't worry too much about him with them, because he's really good at turning his head or moving in his sleep when he flips onto his tum.",beyondthebump

1704,"My SO is dealing with potential postpartum depression, I think.","I gave birth two days ago (I was induced), my SO was with me every step of the way for the last three weeks. He's fantastic, but im worried about him.

My SO and I both have been having bursts of tears, but it seems different for him in comparison to me. I cry from bursts of happiness, joy, awe. He cries from bursts of... well, we don't really know. Sometimes it's panic, sometimes it's anxiety, but most of the time He can't put a name to what he's feeling. 

We both jump every time our son cries, but my SO seems to panic when he can't figure out whats wrong. It seems like he can't just let him cry for a few moments. I dont blame him, I don't like to hear our son cry either because I know he needs something. But I'm concerned that it's a little overboard. 

My SO has been sleeping, but it seems that it's not quality sleep. Because I'm used to not sleeping much, I don't mind the sporadic sleep baby and I are getting. I make sure my SO gets a solid four to six hours of sleep with a two to three hour nap before I ask to switch out for a few hours. 

My SO isn't eating much. Baby is like his father normally is, both normally snack ALL the time. No problem with me, I don't mind. But my SO only just ate after a full 36 hours without food. It's very unlike him and this would be one of the most concerning points out of everything. 

I expected the crying, the anxiety, the issue of sleep, and even some struggle with eating. But the level of all four is enough to make me really worry about him. I dont know what to do other than continue to talk to him about it and poke around (with his permission) to see if he is willing and able to open up about how he's feeling. I'm just at a loss on what more I can do to help and support my partner. Any advice at all would be much appreciated.",beyondthebump

Last week I had to call off Thursday and Friday because I just couldn't do it anymore. Well, then I decided to implement some changes. I decided that I'm going to stop breastfeeding during the day and will introduce formula to my baby. Not only that will save me time, but it will also give my body a break. The other change I decided to make was to sleep train my almost 4 months old son, because 1 we were cosleeping, 2 he takes forever to fallsleep for naps, and they are really short, about 30 minutes. So, I started this weekend, so far the formula has made my baby really gassy and fussy,  and making him sleep on his own on his crib is so heartbreaking.

1707,Letting your family have your LO - how soon is too soon?,"My son is 10 weeks today. The first 6 weeks have been absolute nightmare, sleep deprivation and I had a c section which means my hormones were all over the place and ppd. Me and my husband ended up fighting all the time . My husband's family got involved , my family lives in another country and they can't get here easily. My fil and mil lives 3 hours away . They came over to ours to take care of my LO. I was with them most of the time . It did feel awkward but I was able to go upstairs and have a nap while they looked after my son. 

Now my  sil keeps on asking me to drop off my son for the a day or two so we get some space and rest. I really don't want to give my child to someone for that amount of time. They live about 30 mins away. It doesn't feel right to me . 
I must add this is my husband's brother and wife who wants to take him and I am not very close to them. 
I told my sil that I am not ready to stay away from my son yet I get massive separation anxiety ( I was hovering over my in laws most of the time when they were looking after him) and I think he is too young . My sil in reply pointed out the longer I leave it the separation anxiety gets worst. Does anyone agree? Should I consider their offer? Am I being stupid trying to think that I should spend as much time as I can with him atm because this won't last forever also at this age it's not really good for him to stay away from his mom and dad. It's hard work to take care of a new born but end of the day he is our son , and he is our resposibility. My husband and I just have to work things out and find our feet. 

I do understand he needs to spend time with grandparents or uncles but 2 or 3 is a more appropriate age when he can stay with  them overnight without my or my husband's supervision. 

I am going back to work in few months, I plan to put him in day care when I am at work. Does the separation anxiety get worst if you have your child with you all the time when you go back to work?",beyondthebump

I miss going to all of my appointments and seeing my doctor and the office staff. I miss my bump, feeling kicks, how nice everyone was to me, just the general excitement of becoming a mom for the very first time. And I feel so sad that I’ll never experience pregnancy as a first again. I guess I’m having a hard time coping with the fact that this period of time was so fleeting, and I wish I had cherished it more.

I get a little sad/jealous every time I see pregnancy announcements or someone who’s pregnant now. And the thing is that none of this really makes sense to me, because I was sooo miserable towards the end of my pregnancy. Yet here I am, wanting to do it all over again. 

Honestly, I wouldn’t be mad if I got pregnant right now, but logically I know that it’s not a good idea at all. Financially and physically. Plus, I want to savor this time with my little boy and give him all of my attention for at least a couple of years.

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone else out there has had these crazy feelings too. Does it go away with subsequent pregnancies, or just time alone? Cause I really don’t want this feeling to be consuming me like it has been. It’s something I think about daily.",beyondthebump

I cannot wrap my head around the fact that I'm so much bigger since having a baby. Pre baby I was quite slim (thought I was fat, wish I was that size now!) I easily fit into a UK 8/10. Post baby I wouldn't say I ""pinged"" back but I had a very sickly pregnancy and a 9lb+ baby so it looked as if I'd hardly put any weight on but underneath my clothes my body was totally different. 

Anyway, a year later I've put on almost 2 stone but I keep forgetting until something reminds me, non of my clothes fit or I'll see a photo of myself and be totally shocked. I'm not surprised that I've put on weight, I've been suck inside with a baby for the best part of a year and turned to chocolate to cope with it.

I go back to work next week and that's what's sparked this rant, my work pants definitely don't fit me anymore even though I wore them pregnant, I work with a lot of people and all I can think about is how shocked they'll all be when they see how much weight I've put on.

She has been in the Halo swaddle from birth and it has worked well for us. Recently she’s been sleeping with one arm out of the Halo swaddle and that has gone decently as well.

1731,What would you do? What gender?,"We are currently going through IVF for our second baby. We already have a 3 year old son who we conceived on our own. We were very fortunate that we have 15 embryos that came back from being tested that are healthy: 8 boys and 6 girls. 

Now the big question is what gender to choose. We are comfortable choosing, since we realize someone HAS to. Whether it’s us or the doctor. We originally had a plan of “put whatever embryo is the best quality in there regardless of gender” but now our doctor said there’s excellent ones on both sides and it won’t matter which one. My husband said the doctor might use his own personal biases so we might as well choose ourselves.

Husband would like another boy next. Wants our son to have a brother closer in age. Then would like to transfer one of the girl embryos when we are ready for #3. 

I am more torn. Obviously both of us just want a healthy baby and it is odd to be in this position. Someone in the infertility forum did mention there’s so much hardship to make it to this point, we might as well allow ourselves this part since we made it so far. 

If I had to choose though, I am wondering if a girl would be my choice. I think my son would still play with a sister and he could always have a brother down the line. I feel like having a girl and a boy would be so great, but maybe I’m being impatient. We ultimately want 3-4 kids and I’m hoping I’m able to.

1741,Feeling like I’ve been robbed of joy,"How do you get over feeling like you’ve been robbed of joy?

My baby is 4.5 months old and to say it’s been a hard road so far would be an understatement. 
I had a pretty traumatic birth with some bad tearing and our baby needed to be resuscitated. My recovery from the birth is still ongoing and I have pain daily still. I don’t recognise my body and I hate what I see in the mirror. 
My baby boy had a severe tongue tie from birth that was missed by multiple health professionals so we have had feeding issues, sleeping issues and he’s been unsettled the whole time. I was dismissed by many health professionals and told I was just an “anxious first time mum”. I felt like I was going crazy when everyone told me that he would grow out of it or things would get better but things kept getting worse. I don’t have a lot of support either, my partner works long hours and our families live far away. 

Eventually a lactation consultant found the tongue tie and it was cut around 2 weeks ago. Since then things have gotten even worse, my poor baby is struggling with feeding even more. He’s currently having breast refusal despite being hungry and every feed is a battle. I think I had my hopes set on getting the TT fixed being the magic solution but it hasn’t been. 

Tonight my partner was chatting with a friend that had a baby recently and told me that their baby is sleeping really well and they are loving being parents. Well this was the final straw, I burst into tears. I am just so jealous that they have been able to enjoy their start to parenthood. These past few months have been nothing but stress, worry and anger for me and I feel like my start to motherhood has been so rough. When I look back on the time that has passed I feel so negative about it and I’m sad that I never got to enjoy my first few months of becoming a mother. I feel like I’ve been robbed of that joy and I’m so jealous of others who are loving it. There’s still such a long road ahead with his issues but it just feels like nothing has gone the way I wanted.

Baby also still seems to be taking long naps during the day and night (3-4.5 hours)—I was nervous about weight loss so will try to wake him after a long sleep stretch to feed but I have SO much difficulty getting him up sometimes.

1745,Travelling with baby to Russia — what are you thoughts?,"[Cross-posted from a private bumpers group]
*your thoughts

Hi guys,


At crossroads here and feeling like shit, help me out.


So I am originally from Russia and my father still lives here and is paralyzed with short, albeit not defined (could be year, two, five) life expectancy.
I live in Germany and had my baby here in February.


I promised that I would come visit as soon as situation in Russia gets better. Now Ministry of International Affairs in Germany has lowered the risk assessment for Russia and we could probably go, but I am super anxious about my baby. My current understanding is that infants get COVID, and even though they have milder symptoms, we don’t know about long-term consequences.


I told my father recently that we are not coming anytime soon and since then he was quite depressed (his caretaker told me, not he himself). Our visit is the only thing he has been looking forward to. He only asked me what I think needs to change before we come abs honestly I don’t know. I don’t know if Corona would be gone in his lifetime and I can’t trust Russian statistics either. 


Needless to say, I feel like shit and feel like I am either a bad mother or a bad daughter.

1746,Unpopular Opinion: Snap sleepers aren't that bad,"Hear me out. I always heard that snap sleepers were from the pit of hell and that I should burn them on sight. I should only ever consider buying zip onesies (specifically double zip) or maybe even splurge on the magnetic ones. I would struggle through one bleary-eyed nighttime change when I would get the snaps out of order and never want to use snaps again.

My baby is 8 days old. I have used about half and half snap and zip sleepers, since that's what I was given. My baby is very strong and has a very powerful kick. When I put him in a zip sleeper, I often have to wait for him to calm down and stop kicking enough to get his right leg back into the leg that doesn't unzip. When I use the snaps, I can just get his foot wherever it is and start snapping up from the ankle. I've only snapped wrong one time. And it wasn't a big deal. I can also just leave the top snapped and only undo the snaps I need to. To those who say the double zips do the same thing: yes, until you are changing a blow out you didn't realize was a blow out, and you have brought up the bottom zipper and now have to either bring it all the way back down  along with the top zipper to get the sleeper off or you have to bring the sleeper over your crying baby's head without being able to just lift him out of it. Snaps have no such problem. 

I can't speak to the magnetic sleepers, but I imagine they would be an elegant way of combining what I like about each type. This thrifty mama just hasn't sprung for any yet! 

Tl;Dr: Snap sleepers are fine, and if you get some, give them a chance. Zips have their own problems. You can like both and use both.",beyondthebump
1747,MIL who is vaxxed tested positive after being around the baby for 3 days,"I'm so upset right now. My MIL flew in from out of state for a family event, and before going to the event spent a few days being around us. She did not stay with us, just spent small chunks of time in our home. My husband rode with her to the family events, and I stayed home with the baby.

Today she video calls me and is very obviously sick, and tells me just has ""allergies"". My husband bought her a rapid test, and boom, positive.

She is vaccinated, and so are we. But obviously my 4 month old is not.

I spent this entire year not going anywhere. I didn't even go back to work when things opened up. I don't see my family or my friends. I am so careful. I was anxious about someone flying and seeing our daughter, but my husband reassured me it would be fine.

We all have tests scheduled, husband is in another room with a mask on due to his prolonged exposure in the car, baby is sleeping in the room with me, and I'm worried sick.

She is EBF, I'm hoping I gave her antibodies from the vaccine. I'm so scared. What if she gets very sick?

1748,Expressing milk when out of the house - getting over anxieties and how to do it?,"Has anyone got any tips on how to get over the anxiety/fear of expressing milk when not at home?  Where do you go? How do you do it?  

I had every intention of breastfeeding, but had a horrific experience where my milk had not yet come in and my daughter ended up hospitalised in a matter of days after birth for our baby losing too much weight.  After being groped by dozens of women, having breastfeeding forced down my throat in every conversation, it became too much and I decided I just couldn’t hack it and would opt for expressing milk and topping up with formula whenever necessary. 

It’s been great at home but when we go out, I just really struggle with the idea of breastfeeding at other people’s houses and in public. 

On the occasions we’ve visited family, we both naively assumed a two or three hours and we’d be leaving.  That’s not how our family operates, every visit is an opportunity for everyone and their dog to get together.  It can never be a one or two hour visit, it’s always like a party with dozens of people.  I end up leaving in tears because I am aching, my breasts hurt, I’m leaking through my clothes and feel embarrassed.  

Expressing milk was the compromise I set myself for not wanting to breastfeed.  But the anxiety of doing it away from home is crippling.  

Has anyone else had this difficulty? How did you get more comfortable?  Where do you do it?  Public toilets? The car?  I don’t think I’ll ever have the confidence to do it in public.  No friends or family have ever expressed milk, so they can’t offer me any advice or tips.  How do you store the milk if out and about?",beyondthebump

Level 1 on the DuoGlider is about equivalent to level 6 on our borrowed Graco DuetSoothe swing! Holy crap! I'm freaking out and worried I might have done some brain damage when I had it on 3 or 4 (only partially kidding).  I mean regulations for baby devices on this country (US) are a joke.

1752,i feel like a bad mom.,"usually when someone says they feel like a bad mom it's because they dropped the baby or something like that. i just have the feeling and can't shake it. my son is only eight weeks old and i already feel like i'm failing him. 
actually, i'm realizing maybe there are reasons. i feel like i don't play with him enough. maybe i don't play with him right, and his development is suffering because of it. what if i don't give him enough tummy time? oh but when he cries over tummy time after 30 seconds i feel like a bad mom then too. what if i don't bathe him often enough? he has lint in-between his fingers and beginning stages of cradle cap. now i'm bathing him too often, it's bad for his skin and will dry it out. sometimes i think i'm doing good by breastfeeding him, it's what's ""best"" but after my boob is drained he cries till i make him a bottle and he downs another 4oz. clearly i can't make enough for him, another thing i fucked up. i should of pumped instead of showering so i could keep my supply up. sometimes i listen to people who say they weren't away from their baby for one, sometimes even two years. my son is only eight weeks and on some days all i can think about is how badly i want to ask someone to babysit him for a few hours. i've never let myself, i'd be too nervous but god i feel so pathetic for already wanting a break. 
i love my son to death but nobody tells you how emotionally destroying motherhood can be. so much anxiety and self doubt. they tell you about ppd but not this. when i tried talking to my mom all she could say was ""if you don't feel like a bad mom about one thing, you'll always find another."" i guess i just wasn't prepared to cry every night about how i'm failing my son and all the things i could've done better that day.",beyondthebump
1753,"Just a bit of a rant, maybe someone can relate (on fence about baby #2)","I love the balance we have as a family of three. We can rest during her naps, she’s an easy baby and I had an easy recovery and if we stop now we’d leave this whole pregnancy and infancy stage off on a good note. We have free time for us as a couple, it’s very low stress, and it’s not a hassle to bring her along on our adventures.

On the other hand, I can not imagine her growing up alone. I know a lot of people have their own views on that but all I can draw from is my experience. No matter how many stories I read of siblings growing up to hate eachother, I have not experienced or witnessed it, no matter how much I read the statement “siblings are not a guarantee”, I can’t relate or imagine growing up without one. I don’t even personally know any only children but one and she represents every bad stereotype about it. I know I swear I know those stereotypes usually aren’t true. I just can’t imagine family game nights with only one child and two adults, christmas morning with only one child, movie nights, family reunions, weekend breakfast even, I just can’t imagine only one. Then I get scared of how that would mess up the harmony we have now, then I get scared to never know a second baby to have and to hold and to love and bring more joy into our lives, then I get scared to be in more stress and be overwhelmed.

When I see my dad that is working 16 hour days, 7 days a week and I know his health is deteriorating. It makes me feel so sad. When I have I watched a crime show the other day, about parents who were charged with neglect and abuse because their daughter died. She was 8lbs at 10 months old. I was crying for awhile and couldn't stop thinking about it. If someone close to me tells us about something they are going through, it's as if I feel their anxiety and sadness. It could be a complete stranger, and it's as if my heart feels their struggle. I'm a very sensitive person, especially before pregnancy and birth, but I wasn't expecting this.

1757,8 Weeks PP. I want to kill myself.,"I don't know what I'm hoping for here. Solidarity maybe? Experiences from others who have been through it? 

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. 2 years ago I made a suicide attempt that landed me inpatient for 48 hours, those were the worst 2 days of my life (I was diagnosed later with PTSD due to my hospital stay). I got help afterwards that worked well, a medication treatment and therapy, and after about 6 months I felt amazing for the first time. 

Then I got pregnant and had to stop taking my meds, covid canceled my therapy and I was put on high watch for PPD. 

I had my son and while he is the light of my life I feel no connection to him, no interest. I take care him, but feel like a failure because breastfeeding didn't work out due to me having IGT. I want to stay in bed all day and pretend I'm not a parent. I worry so much about my baby dying that it feels like the only solution is for me to die. 

Despite being marked as high risk there has been no follow-up. The one psychiatrist I saw refused to put me back on my meds because she felt they didn't help me before (they literally saved my life previously). I think about killing myself everyday, every moment. My son would be so much better off without me. My partner is depressed too, I feel I'm the cause of that. I know how I'd do it, I even know what time of day. I know my partners plan on what he'd if anything happened to me. I have all my ducks in a row basically. 

I know I need help, desperately, but I am petrified about being hospitalized again. I can't be separated from my partner and son. I fear telling any professional how I feel because it end in an inpatient stay where I wouldn't be able to see them or text them or call them. I would be more isolated than I already feel. 

I'm at a loss of what to do, I don't always want to die because I know it can be better, but I just can't see a way out of this.",beyondthebump

However I still feel a “heavyness” down there and I can’t even stand for more than 3 minutes without being in pain. When I asked the Obgyn she said it’s not normal since I should be healed by now and that I’m probably imagining the pain. She suggested pelvic floor PT, which I intend on going to. 

My vaginal bleeding otherwise had stopped completely about 2 weeks ago. Today I noticed blood on my underwear again so I put on a pad to see how much I was bleeding and where it was coming from. It looked more like spotting throughout the day and it was not in the general area on the pad that it would be if i had my period. I looked in the mirror and it appeared to be from my urethra.

I called my Obgyn who said it might be a UTI so I went to urgent care and tested positive. They prescribed antibiotics.

Looking for some advice/hopefully positive stories about pp migraines. Prior to pregnancy I would get a migraine with aura about once a month-ish right around my period. I treated them with a triptan and went on my merry way. During pregnancy I did not get a migraine once. 

They returned with a vengeance pp. I get them almost weekly, and then this week, I have had two throughout the week. I am 12 weeks pp. I assume that since I didn’t get them during pregnancy that hormones are a big player here.

Anyone else experience this? If so, does it ever get better?? I am starting to get really depressed about it. The medication isn’t working as well, and being already sleep-deprived I am just getting increasingly tired and sick of feeling like crap all the time.

A lactation consultant has confirmed latch and feeding appears to be good.

1770,Another husband rant from an unhappy heterosexual mama,"For context, I'm in medical training and my schedule is a nightmare, and my husband stays at home.  We invited MIL to stay with us so my husband can fix up our basement in order to rent it out.  MIL also brought her mother to live with us, so it's 4 adults and 2 toddlers.  Six of us are basically living in 1300 sqft.

My MIL has been living with us for over a year now, and literally does everything - dishes, laundry, cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids  and her mom all day.  Most days, I come home and husband is playing video games.  Had a big, tearful conversation with him about it, so now he watches youtube instead.  The basement is still unfinished.  It's been 2 years since we bought our house.

So MIL decides to go on vacation for a few weeks - and she should, she damn well deserves it, the poor woman.  I wish I could pay her or something, but I provide nearly 100% support for all six of us and have so little leftover.

Well... my husband can't handle it.  The house is now a disaster.  There are no meals.  The dishes are filthy.  He was in tears because ""I can't stay up late.  I can't sleep in.  I'm so tired!""

YES???  AND???  I wake up at 6am every day and when I get home from work, if the kids are still up, I feed and bathe them and get them in bed, and do the laundry, wash a few dishes.  There are days where I literally have no downtime, and here he is bellyaching that he only gets two hours a day to himself.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  He is so willing to sacrifice everyone else around him so he can go relax.  And now that the responsibility is on him, it's just too hard.  I have no empathy.

I feel like I'm just hauling around a dead weight all the fucking time.  I'm so disappointed and sad and just so over it.  I desperately want to leave, but with my financial situation and literally no family support, I don't know what to do.  I can't afford a divorce and then alimony?  I barely make enough as it is to support everything.

1771,What made breastfeeding worth it for you?,"I'm almost one week postpartum with our baby girl and nursing has been hard.

I gave my nipples a nursing break yesterday and just pumped and was reminded how much I hated EP-ing with my first. It's doable right now because my husband is home and can bottle feed while I pump, but feeding then pumping takes forever and I'd rather get rest!

All of that to say: moms who had trouble nursing in the beginning but were able to eventually nurse long term, was it worth it to push past the issues? If yes, what is it about nursing that made the initial struggle worth it? I specifically call out nursing here because I know that if we can't establish nursing, I'm not going to exclusively pump like I did with my first.",beyondthebump

1776,Overbearing family,"Need advice here. My husband and I brought home the first grandchild on both sides this week. During the lead up I have been hearing from my family how excited my brother and father (baby’s uncle and grandfather) are to “mold” the baby to enjoy their interests (happen to be very into music, they plan on exposing my child to music and music events etc). My brother gifted my child a cute little music instrument and posted a video of him
Singing to the baby, with lots of comments from people about how the baby is “next” for the band. While I appreciate the enthusiasm, I am feeling miffed because my husband and I are not into the music scene, and quite frankly we don’t want anyone “molding” our baby into anything. The fun part of being a parent is exposing the child to your interests, but this is OUR child, not theirs. I mentioned to my mom today that my brother and father need to back off a bit and it feels like they are stepping on our toes. I’m not sure if she will pass along the message. Im anticipating having to say more to handle this situation - has anyone run into anything similar and do you have advice?",beyondthebump
1777,"Whenever I learn that someone has children, I automatically assume they are less intelligent than before","This is a matter of pure statistics. Uneducated/unintelligent people breed more than educated/intelligent ones. Therefore, whenever I learn that someone has a child, I assume they are less intelligent than I had prior to learning that fact. 

Each additional child lowers my estimation of one’s intelligence.

Having a child earlier in life lowers my estimation more than having one later in life

Having a child out of wedlock lowers my estimation more than having a child in wedlock

All of this is based on statistics regarding intelligence and fertility data",beyondthebump

1781,To guilt or not to guilt?,"Sorry for the novel, also am on mobile: I am finally realizing that I have some hurt feelings and maybe even trauma after having four kids. Husband works very long hours so isn't around alot. He was very attentive for the birth of our first, helped out where he could. Birth went great, I loved being a mom and was ready for another very quickly. I know I didn't let him do enough, because I thought it was my job to take care of baby and his job to go to work. Unhealthy precedent that has come back to haunt me. 

He now thought that since I am supermom, I am fully able to do it all myself, even though every kid obviously adds to my workload. Second birth was a little traumatic, made worse by him being in the room but not really involved until the very end. I had to ask him to put his phone down several times to help me through a contraction. Third and forth babies, same story even though we had talked about it ahead of time. Also, he is self employed and ""had to get back to the shop"" so left me home the day after giving birth with toddlers and a newborn. He worked half days that first week and then back to full time. 

We are done having kids, there's no way I can handle more on my plate.  Basically, I'm drowning here. I've talked to him about it, he insists that 'you're the best mom there is and I will do whatever I can to help you. You want me home more? All you have to do is ask!' Like, dude, I just told you I'm drowning. Does a drowning person really have to look around and find someone and ask them pretty please for help?

Sorry, I think this turned into more of a rambling vent than asking for advice. I am wondering whether to bring up some of the old hurts that I've been nursing, or to just let it go and try to move us both on. If I tell him exact things I need, he will happily do those, but the mental labor is still mine. I don't want to make him feel bad about his past failings, but I desperately need things to change.",beyondthebump

Since yesterday morning, he started being extremely cranky and seems to be tired a lot sooner than usual. He still takes 2 naps, but he was so cranky almost an hour before his usual nap time, we actually didn’t think he needed to sleep. We checked his temperature, checked his gum for swelling, tried to give him a snack, but it turned out that he wanted to sleep. 

Afternoon was the same, very cranky and completely inconsolable. No distractions worked, no snack, and because it was only a couple of hours since his long afternoon nap, we don’t think he was tired. Going outside helped a bit, but once he was inside, he started crying uncontrollably. 

Bedtime was fine, but he cried once he was in bed until he fell asleep, which is unusual for him. 

Woke up happy this morning, but after a couple of hours, it’s the same thing again. We don’t see any swollen teeth, no fever. There wasn’t any unusual activity that could have made him up extra tired. Anybody could share an idea? I feel so bad for him:(",beyondthebump

Obviously during lockdown he was home too but since last September he's been on placement or going to his parents to work because our house is all open plan there's nowhere for him to work here and lectures have been online.

Now we're at the stage where she aggressively prefers me, and is demanding I follow her back and forth in our living room when she's literally going the length of the ottoman I was previously sat on. And I'm tired, I love her but I hate being the one she prefers.

1790,Can anyone who had a chronic placental abruption tell me how your birth experience went?,"Hi all!

I am a STM, currently 35 weeks pregnant. I am scheduled for a c-section at 37 weeks because the baby is breech. If the baby moves into the correct position on his own or if they can successfully get him to turn during the ECV, I will be opting for a vaginal delivery instead of a c-section.

I’m very nervous about giving birth because of the chronic marginal placental abruption. I’ve had 3 different bleeds, one at 24 weeks, one at 28 and this last one at 34 weeks which have all landed me in the hospital for monitoring for about a week. I am nervous about losing an exceptional amount of blood during delivery, or attempting to deliver vaginally and my placenta separating completely.

1794,Husband Shamed Me for Accepting Help,"We’re first time parents to a 3 week old baby and have been going through the usual hardships and adjustments to having a newborn. We’re pretty isolated where we are and no family close by. My husband works 9-10 hours a day so it’s just me and baby majority of the time. 

My brother and sister-in-law flew in for a week visit beginning yesterday. SIL is a legit super mom with two of her own. She adores kids and is amazing with them. Last night baby was especially finicky and not wanting to go to sleep. After a few hours of unsuccessful soothing and me starting to unravel, SIL graciously offers to sit with her for a couple hours and let me get some much needed rest. 

I accepted without hesitation. I laid down and heard baby calm soon thereafter. Husband then lays into me about how dare I let someone else be with our child while I sleep and that I’m shirking the responsibility that we signed up for. He completely guilt tripped me and made me feel like I failed by letting SIL take the baby. What was supposed to be a time of precious rest turned into an argument and took forever for my adrenaline to return to normal. 

Eventually we both fell asleep and what do you know? SIL sneaks into room and drops baby off seamlessly into bassinet and disappears. It was magical to me but I don’t know if my husband will ever see my side. 

Did I do the wrong thing? I’ve always read to accept help where I can get it and SIL is a very trusted family member. But now I’m hesitant to accept any more help from her this week.",beyondthebump

This has been going on for a couple of days too (we are on leave over the summer). So I just wanted to let everyone know it's in the cards even with small kids.

The game changer for us was moving 11 mo into his own room with a floor bed. He usually wakes up at 5-ish just to go for a crawl and then go back to sleep (don't ask - baby logic). Since he now can get in and out of his bed in the baby proof room he can manage that on his own.
Granted half of the time he re-collapses in front of the bed or on the large pillow I have put there as a ""ramp"" but he doesn't seem to mind so whatever.

UPDATE from post 3 months ago, I’m sorry I have nowhere to turn. If you read the below post before the update is : I took a job for $19 an hour and got fired cuz I got into a car accident where I could’ve died the week AFTER my dad got his prostate cancer removed. My partner and i are down to one income , i was supposed to be using the money from this job to rebuild my business that failed during pandemic…i also had to drop out of LAW SCHOOL my life’s dream because of our finances.……..it’s been a month of searching for s new job and nothing is working. I have $200 to my name .I think I am going to end my life today. I have considered Baker Acting/5150 myself but I know I can’t handle being locked up with no ability to exit the facility  . I gave birth during Covid so I have some bad anxiety about being back in a hospital locked up for 3 whole days cuz it was soooooooooo miserable. I think I’m just gonna end it today. I am fantasizing about just drinking some bleach or running into traffic. 

Baby is 1 year and 1 month, and we still have not recovered our finances...right when I was about 3 months pregnant we lost everything , all our savings due to financial emergency after emergency....



I’m 28,When we planned our baby, we were going to do engagement right around the same 3 month mark , and now as we speak I’m dealing with a flooded house! Like I’m starting to feel this will never work out for us. It’s like in one fell swoop I lost my maternity joy, engagement joy, wedding joy, some of the most important milestones that we remember forever. 

I was even being attacked by someone at 5 months pregnant, almost losing the baby, and spending the last year and change in court trying to get justice !. It made me give birth 6 weeks early too; it was horrible.

not to mention I was 2500 miles from my family in the Bay Area for 8 whole months, I just came back to Miami area , so this whole time it was just me and my man 100% of the time with the baby, no time for ourselves.

.We make good money but it’s always gone because something is always going wrong....
Right before the shutdown we were making headway to rebuilding ourselves...then the shutdown happened and we are still struggling. My partner had a successful event planning business and he lost thousands on thousands in deposits due to the shutdown .

And we have always spent below our means, used budgets etc.

I love my partner and baby. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. But I really feel so ashamed deep down for how everything turned out. Just need some support ...cuz most people assume when everything goes wrong that you didn’t save or plan properly..especially in communities of color.. And we did all of those things, I promise you... but life had other plans. And having to celebrate my friends and family as they get to enjoy these things has been hell for me, but I still just try to forget about my own situation cuz it’s not like they made this happen to me. And I’ve even had a couple people I trusted make fun of my situation and abandon me, so that was also painful. This journey has been crazy. It really has.

Maybe it’s just the fact that I haven’t made small talk with a stranger in a year and a half, but I have never heard someone say so many potentially offensive things to me in one conversation. I was literally too fascinated to be actually offended. I feel like it’s just catch-up for being pregnant during the pandemic, because this is the first time I’ve ever heard an older lady actually say these things out loud.

So if your mother-in-law believes that your cloth diapers are disgusting, you breastfed your baby way too long, you didn’t cover up enough when you nursed, you didn’t stay hydrated enough while you nursed(?!), you spent too much money on formula for combo feeding, and apparently your baby’s allergies can be cured by giving him his allergens…. she’s at Target talking shit about you in the baby aisle.

I *almost* had to feel bad for her, because she was clearly looking for a sympathetic ear  and just chose *very very* wrong. It was almost a guilty pleasure to disagree with her so many times in a row. So whoever’s MIL that is, I’m so sorry, and bless you for putting up with her.",beyondthebump
1824,How to cook soft/juicy meats?,"My daughter just turned one and is starting to reject food (she used to eat anything). I'm not sure if it's because she's in a bad mood or what but I'm afraid she's becoming a picky toddler. 

I used to slow cook chicken tenders or Angus beef. After I shred them, I blend them up. But the meat is kinda hard and dry for some reason... And honestly even I wouldn't eat it. It tastes good but the texture is too dry.

Is there another way to cook softer meats? I'm at all loss... Thank you.",beyondthebump

1826,Noxious Baby Butt,"At the risk of sounding completely ridiculous, my baby has the most putrid smelling ass I’ve literally ever experienced. At the tender age of four months , Her farts can only be out stunk by the absolute horror story that is her poops. Usually, I would treat this like any other baby thing, do what I can to deal with it until it’s replaced by the next woe - but this is my third child , and I’ve never experienced anything remotely like it, and I’ve exhausted every resource that I and google can come up with…and if I can’t get a solution, commiseration will have to do. What follows is a grievous tale , but it must be told.

All babies get gassy, obviously, and usually with time and maybe some gas drops, the plumbing issues smooth themselves out. But understand me when I say: this baby is not “just gassy”. This baby is a god damn blimp from hell. She farts CONSTANTLY. As in, I’d estimate it would work out to about a fart every 10 minutes if you spread them out individually over 24 hours (yeah I thought about it THAT much). Worse: she basically lives for the next fart; if she’s not actively farting she’s trying to push another one out, with varying levels of effort ranging from “oh that just slipped out” to “ALL HANDS ON THE POOP DECK-GET THIS OUT OF MY BUTT IMMEDIATELY”. The theme song of my life is being continuously played by an ass horn. Melodious. 

Naturally, Sleep is no match for the ass gas express. This baby will thump and twist and writhe in her swaddle and snoo like there’s a rave going on until she works one out, and of course by that point, everyone is awake and unwillingly aboard the train to stinkville. She wasn’t a good sleeper to begin with, but everything can just go right to hell when the urge to butt purge is upon her. It’s gas blast or bust. 

As You might have guessed by this point in the story, I’m rather severely sleep deprived (and so is miss sweet cheeks). The butt is master now. 
I have yet to find an identifiable culprit. I feel like I’ve tried everything? She eats normally- formula fed with Enfamil A2, and gets oatmeal as well for her night time feeds. She burps. She is happy most of the time and a weepy mess every so often, in utterly ordinary baby fashion. Gas drops appear to only anger the gas gods that rule from inside her butthole. Gripe water might as well be prune juice . Bicycle legs are no match for this particular fat bottomed girl. And the windi…it was the most anticlimactic and disappointing attempt of all - more of whisper, and not worth the trauma inherent with sticking a plastic tube up your kids butt. So, in sum, nothing seems to help.The gas simply must be passed.

Before you ask: of COURSE she poops with enviable regularity- usually once every day, and has never gone longer than two days without brownies to show for all the baking going on. But remember when I said this kid’s farts were a torture so heinous even a republican   would call it excessive force? Well, then her poops can only be deemed a god damn war crime. 

Before you call me a wimp and head back to r/all, let it be known: I’ve seen my fair share of shit- adult shit, kid shit, dog shit- it smells, it’s gross, but it’s just shit; you get over it, tough up and carry on. I’m fully confident in my ability to handle the worst of the human body’s expulsions without much more than a grimace. Or rather, I was. Then this baby started churning out poops the smell of which words cannot even attempt to accurately describe. But I’ll try:
If the devil took a dump, then let it rot in the sulfurous depths of hell for an age, before soaking it in a warm blanket of Floridian humidity and finally baking it in the Phoenix summer sun , that dump would be a lightly scented, de-fucking-light after the PTSD-inducing nightmare that my kid is birthing from her butt every day. 

It’s A poop that would otherwise be utterly unremarkable in its ordinariness. But Jesus fuck, the otherworldly strength of its shit stench cannot be understated - you can smell it from anywhere in the 2500 square feet of my house, distance be damned. 

So all that to say: anyone else have a baby with a weapon of mass destruction where a cute little butt should be? Or, if you are blessed with a baby that produces normal amounts of non hazardous waste, please tell me what you are doing to appease the god of butt thunder? We’re planning to consult the pediatrician at our next visit, but I’ll try anything to make it even slightly more bearable.",beyondthebump

1840,10 month old struggling with solids- help!,"My baby will sometimes eat a small serving of puree or a few puffs, but most meals are completely rejected. When I give her small, mushy finger foods like pancakes, she  seems to spit everything out. 

Here's our feeding history-- can anyone relate or offer advice?

* 6 MONTHS OLD: I offer purees once a day, but she refuses and cries at every meal. 
* 7 MONTHS OLD: I'm frustrated, so I start BLW. I take the Feeding Littles class on it and decide to start with banana and avocado. She occasionally brings the food to mouth, but doesn't ever bite off a piece or chew. I try to keep it simple and only offer avocado, banana, and oatmeal once or twice a day this month. She eats nothing, but enjoys playing with the food.
* 8 MONTHS OLD: I decide to do both purees and the BLW servings of avocado and banana twice a day. She will sometimes eat 1-2 bites of a puree, but most days she rejects both feedings. The banana and avocado slices are never consumed, so I decide that BLW didn't work for us. 
* 9 MONTHS OLD: Her pediatrician is emphatic that I get her eating more solids and finger foods. I start offering her purees and puffs 3 times a day. After a week of gagging and vomiting twice, she actually eats a puff and I am elated!! Typical daily consumption= 1T pureed pears and a few puffs.... We are making progress, but not much.
* 10.5 MONTHS OLD (right now): I offer at least 3 solid meals a day and sometimes 2 solid snacks. She still cries often when I put her in the high chair and refuses some meals entirely. She will only eat pureed pear, sweet potato, and puffs. I've tried to offer her diced up pancakes and she chews on them, but ends up spitting out every bite. Daily consumption is about 50-100 calories and she is still drinking \~34 oz of formula a day.

I have 3 theories about what is going on. 

A. This is normal and she is a really picky eater.

B. This is my fault. The gagging/vomiting incidents scared me and I haven't been offering enough foods or textures.

C. She needs to see a feeding therapist. (The fact that she spits out every bite of diced pancake each day makes me think this.)

I’ve struggled with my body image since I was a young teen (I’m sure almost all of us can relate). Even though I recovered from my ED as a teen, my relationship with my weight/body has always been overshadowed by body dysmorphia.

I am so surprised, and so humbled, that I am IN LOVE with my postpartum body. My birth experience totally transformed my self-confidence and body image. I have more stretch marks and pudge, and my hips will probably never go back, but I LOVE the body I see in the mirror. My body conceived a human, grew him and kept him safe, and now it’s nourishing him. I finally grasp the power of my female body.

1875,I'm haunted by thoughts of pregnancy/birth. And I feel horrible. Don't know if I should just keep going or try to stop it.,"About me: I'm a 43 year old man.  I have no biological children but I did raise my ex-wife's daughter from age 2 to 12\* (her dad wasn't involved), and before that I also took care of a newborn from birth to 3 months with a single mom who was living with me at the time.  So I consider myself essentially a dad, or a former dad.

For my entire adult life the topics of pregnancy, childbirth, and raising infants has filled me with extreme anxiety, dread, and above all shame.  My mother (and to a lesser extent the other women in my family, like my aunts and older sister) was openly resentful about having to have been pregnant.  When I was about 10 my mom told me someday a woman would ""ruin her body for me"" (her exact words) yet I would ""never truly love the baby because it didn't come out of \[me\]"" (not her exact words, but something to that effect).  My father, meanwhile, was a small-town doctor who did just about every kind of medical service under the sun and liked to talk about the gruesome situations he encountered.  (I do not want to debate whether they were right or wrong.  They are entitled to their opinions).

The thought of **anyone** having to go through pregnancy has always made me sick to my stomach.  I truly can't imagine a more horrible experience (besides giving birth), and I have been repeatedly assured by my family and others that birth is worse than anything my small male brain can conceive of, let alone understand.  I think children are wonderful, but **reproduction** is an atrocity to me.  In my twenties I got a vasectomy so I could never impregnate anyone.  I could never live with myself if I did.

I've always felt ashamed of myself for getting to enjoy being a ""dad"" without having to go through pregnancy.  As if I stole it.  And my mom's words just keep echoing in my mind: I would never really love my baby because it didn't come out of me.  And I could never imagine how awful it is.  What if she's right?  There's no way I could possibly prove her wrong.

I think about how horrible pregnancy/birth must be all the time, and it haunts me.  Just skimming the titles of the posts in this sub makes my heart race.  It's horrifying to me...so much worse than anything I could ever go through.

I've been like this for many years, but it's steadily getting worse.  I'm now having trouble getting my work done.  A coworker has a new baby and everyone is sharing congratulations and happy thoughts, and I feel like I was sent here from another planet...all I feel is sorrow for them.  It's hard for me to have sex, because I can't avoid the thought that sex is what causes pregnancy.  I feel like talking about it might give me some insight, but there's nobody to talk with. My girlfriend (a mom) doesn't want to talk about this because she feels it's disrespectful to her children (I mean no disrespect, her kids are lovely).  My ex wife never wanted to talk about this because she thought it was weird.  I see a therapist, but she only wants to talk about my relationship, which is in a rough patch.

Part of me thinks this is hurting me and not helping anyone else, and it needs to stop.  Another part of me feels like I deserve this, since I never went through what you/my ex went through, and I need to grow up.  After all, you moms have to think about this stuff pretty much nonstop, forever.  I just don't know what to do.  I feel like a weakling and a crybaby.

What do I do?  Thank you to anyone who made it this far.  And to you moms: I am **so, so sorry** for all you have had to go through, and if there was anything I could do to undo your suffering, I would do it.

Sometimes, your a smooth, get-to-know you kinda pain. You let me think I’m totally ready for the long hual with not even the slightest blip of pain in the early minutes. It makes sense…I’m only soothing a 10 pounder, it’s not that much strain! But then, the nap is not going well, and you give me a nudge. You slowly warn me that I’m in for a world of hurt if my posture and soothing method goes on much longer. And…I appreciate that. It allows me to get my partner after a good college try, or even set the LO down for a bit so I can focus on you and what will keep you happy. 

However, other times, you’re just a jealous asshole. You know what I’m talking about. Those days when I start the soothing process and you quickly seize up, forcing me to do the one thing I told myself I wouldn’t do…*immediately* cry out to my partner for help after repeatedly saying, “I got this one”. You trigger that belly flop collapse of embarrassment before I can even get the drowsy eyes started. Where does this come from? Why do you always seem to act this way when I (read: my partner and my baby) need you the most? 

Look, I’m trying to get better about giving you more support, but for now, can you cut me a bit of slack?

1887,Dealing with an upset neighbor,"Hi all, after 4 weeks of someone in my family being sick at any given time (yes, also over our first family vacation) we came home this weekend to find out my son (16mo) has RSV. We’ve obviously had to keep him home for the week from daycare and he has been…a lot. So many meltdowns, etc. We are really doing our best, we don’t let him cry, we try to find a solution but we are also both working from home full time. On top of this, we live in LA where Covid cases are on the rise and it’s very hot so honestly doing anything outside of our apartment isn’t really an option (also we are all probably contagious). I got what I felt was a very passive aggressive/unhelpful text from our upstairs neighbor today (we live in a triplex) that just sent me into a spiral (will post screenshot in comments). Basically implying there is something wrong with our son (well yeah he is sick) but not helpful at all. For background, we just moved in 2 months ago and I feel like we’ve been very respectful neighbors. The neighbor that texted me doesn’t have kids, but has always been pretty nice and seems to like our son.

Besides leaving (which as I mentioned aboveisnt really an option) I don’t know what else we can possibly do. We are also miserable and I’m 8 months pregnant so it’s not fun for us either. Apparently the building has terrible insulation but again, I can’t fix that. I can’t make a sick toddler not cry as much as we try.

1890,7 Week baby/ PP- When does it get easier?,"A little background:

I have two boys. One is almost 5 years, and one just turned 7 weeks today. With my firstborn, I had an extremely traumatic pregnancy, birth, and postpartum period (while going through debilitating health issues at the time) all while simultaneously going through a VERY abusive and narcissistic relationship with my first born’s father for many years. I wouldn’t wish it upon my WORST enemy, but I’m so thankful I’m no longer with him. 


I’ve now been with an AMAZING man for the past 3 years, and he’s been nothing short of incredible. Unfortunately, I’m currently dealing with a LOT of trauma/ triggers during this postpartum period, as that was when the abuse was at its peak with my last relationship. Examples: Constant abusive put-downs, alienation from friends/ family (would tell constant lies about me) being made to feel ‘lazy/ unworthy’ if I didn’t do a set amount of housework (with a newborn), being told that he wasn’t ‘attracted to depressed people (withheld sex for over 2 years- made to feel that it was my fault), yelling at me for being able to soothe my son when he couldn’t, I had absolutely no help with my firstborn- That man would nap constantly just to shove it in my face while I would cry from severe lack of sleep/ help, made to feel ashamed about how I looked/ dressed/ acted/ talked, etc. That’s only a small bit of what I dealt with daily for many, many years. 


I guess what I’m asking is- is it normal not to really be able to get much done with a 7 week old? I truly don’t know what’s normal this time around, and I legitimately have CONSTANT anxiety/ panic attacks from feeling like I’m ‘not doing enough.’ My son needs to be constantly held, soothed, and won’t nap unless I’m holding him, and I MAYBE get an hour total to do anything all day. My current partner works full time, but he’s extremely hands on when he’s home, and always assures me that I’m doing enough, but it’s so, so hard to believe him at times. My son is very healthy and extremely happy and smily, but I don’t get much time to really DO anything else other than making sure he’s cared for. 

Could you please tell me what an average day looks like for you with a young baby? I’m really struggling with how much I’m able to do right now, and really need a bit of assurance that I’m doing everything right.

I don't generally have a lot of anxiety about her-- except for when it comes to this. I'm just terrified, I don't know how else to say it.

I took the questionnaire (don't remember what it's called) at my baby's 1 month checkup. I scored a 10 which was enough to have them give me a phone call, but it wasn't worrying to them.

Had gestational diabetes through pregnancy. Induced due to GD, had a wonderful quick delivery, perfectly healthy baby.

We leave the hospital. She eats the right amount of oz per day, but every hour since the hard work makes her sleepy. I'm exclusively pumping, and only producing &gt;oz per pump. I'm crying every day for 3 weeks straight.

I stop pumping at 3 weeks, and my mood increases drastically.

5 weeks and she's still sleeping an hour at a time. I'm crying every day again. I feel trapped in my body, I just want to run and bike again. She only contact naps, I'm stuck on the couch.

1902,8 months pregnant and need advice + pep talk,"Hi everyone,

I'm 8+ months pregnant, and I'm absolutely miserable. Thankfully, the pregnancy itself has gone really well - no issues with the baby and I've been able to go about my normal routines very well. I've had a series of crazy health issues in the past, so I'm really happy and grateful that everything has gone so smoothly, physically speaking.

The mental ride, on the other hand, has been extremely rough. I think most of my issues are circumstantial, but are probably heightened by hormones. I'm looking for advice or even a peptalk from others who may have been through something similar. I apologize this is a bit of a rant, but here's the cliff-notes version of my life in the last 8 months:

* Once I got pregnant, my hubby and I decided to move back to our hometown to have more support. We were currently living in an expensive coastal city. This was more my decision than his. He reluctantly agreed out of pragmatism, but has been nervous about how it will affect his career options. I feel guilty for pushing this move since I know it's not his first choice.
* He's an independent contractor, so I needed to be the one to find a new job with benefits. I found a new job, and OH BOY is it not what I was expected (in the worst ways possible). More on that later.
* The move itself was really hard emotionally and physically. As an independent contractor, my husband is by nature kinda workaholic. He was cramming a bunch of deadlines as we're trying to make the move and it was really hard on our relationship. Not to mention a year+ sharing a small 1 BR apartment had already put us on edge...
* Thankfully, we were able to buy a house in our new city, but it took a while and in the interim we've been in airbnbs/staying with parents and friends. Oftentimes we stay in different places because we need very different environments for our work schedules (I'm in meetings all day, he's working independently - we butt heads a lot when we're in the same small space). So yeah, I wouldn't say we've had much quality time together or really had any opportunity for fun in the last few months.
* Our relationship has also soured due to my horrible insomnia. I've had insomnia on and off for years, and it doesn't help that my husband snores. Now, with me being pregnant and waking up to pee all the time, it's virtually impossible for us to sleep in the same bed. I honestly don't care - I can get intimacy in other ways than physically sleeping next to someone - but my husband is really frustrated by it, which makes me feel really guilty, but also annoyed that he doesn't understand how truly terrible insomnia can be. It used to be as long as I had my own space, my insomnia was in check, but now because I'm so stressed at work I'm having a hard time sleeping even on my own. This is unusual for me and makes me extra anxious as to how I will manage these sleeping issues with a newborn.
* So, WORK. I inherited a really dysfunctional team. There are a lot of difficult personalities and since I started remotely and had no experience working with them pre-COVID, there is zero respect for my authority. I don't say this as someone who needs to be on a power trip. I am an anti-micromanager and constantly am asking for input and collaboration, but no matter how gracious I am, they continue to be terrible and disrespectful. I have a demanding job before taking into consideration the supervisory component, but given how difficult they are I've found my time has been sucked into exhausting debates about tiny, small, insignificant things. I have to work a lot longer hours just to catch up, and it's really difficult because of how emotionally draining dealing with them is. Basically, these people don't want to do basic aspects of their jobs. I'm getting pressure from higher up to make them, which only makes things worse. I now have extreme dread and anxiety every day knowing I have another day of fires and battles. Since I'm a new employee I only get a month of maternity leave. I know this is better than most other women in the US (don't even get me started on this!), but the idea of going back to such a toxic place a month after having a baby seems unimaginable. I have NO IDEA how I will be able to do it.
* In an age where the country is so polarized, both my husband and I are nervous as to how we will fit in socially. We relocated to a medium sized metro area in the South, where we're both from, and while we have family and childhood friends, we're not sure we will ""fit in"" with other people our age. The South has a very distinct culture and politics that my husband and I don't align with. Not trying to start anything political here - the main takeaway is that we feel isolated socially and don't really know how to remedy that.

So, that's where things are at. Both my husband and I are so burnt out from moving, work, life changes, etc, that we feel like we didn't get to enjoy this pregnancy at all. It's only been stress for us, and I hate that this is the energy we're bringing into the homestretch and potentially the first few months of our baby boy's life. I'm also terribly worried that this stress will trigger PPD, since I have pretty much all of the risk factors (move, job stress, relationship stress, etc). I definitely had some generalized anxiety issues pre-pregnancy, but I never took medication since it was always manageable with lifestyle adjustments. 

At this point, I need to make some sort of change. I'm strongly considering leaving my job after my month of leave, but I'm worried about the professional repercussions that will have. Until this job, I've always been really career-driven and ambitious. I still am, but I just HATE every second of my work. Leaving will be a huge financial blow (losing both salary and benefits), but I just don't know if I have the mental strength to go back to such a horrible environment when I have a newborn. But then I also worry that the financial stress leaving will cause will create a whole new set of problems.

I'm also thinking of going on some sort of medication. Objectively speaking, I know I've had a really tough year and I think, despite it all, I'm still coping relatively okay. But i don't want to be just ""relatively okay"" for the rest of my life. I hate feeling like I'm barely holding it together. But I know once you're on antidepressants it is really hard to wean off of them, and I truly think most of my problems are due to the current circumstances of the next year. But...I don't want to keep living like this. So... I'm torn if medication should be something I pursue.

Any advice/others who've been in similar situations? Has anyone ever had such a stressful pregnancy that having a newborn was a \*relief\*?? I'm really hoping that's what happens to us and this will provide us an opportunity to slow down a bit and just focus on our relationship and family, without all the other bullshit we've dealt with the last year.

1907,Morning routine after maternity leave?,"Wondering if you could share how you managed transitioning to daily life post maternity leave. Specially morning routines for getting ready for work with a baby. Right now we go off baby's own wake cycles but once leave is over, we need to up and ready by a certain time.

1909,Fitness trackers,"Hi all,

I'm wanting to start getting my fitness back and starting with walking. I'm hoping to gradually increase the steps I do each day. When I'm pushing the pram though my fitness watch doesn't count the steps and I'm assuming that's because I'm not moving my arms.

I do have the option of wearing it round my ankle and doubling the steps as it only counts one for every two but this will be an issue when it starts getting colder and I can't just wear trainers. 

Does anyone have one they could recommend that will count as I'm holding the pram?",beyondthebump

Has anyone had experience with their older baby or sheltered pandemic baby starting daycare?? 

I'm thinking I'll start slow, like an hour here and there since I'm not certain exactly when we start back at the office (we have on-site daycare, they're reopening September 1st no matter what while the company I work for may or may not depending on the data for covid between now and rhen).

1915,You're being gaslit by the healthcare system; your pain is real.,"I am so upset right now. For reference, I am 6 months postpartum, generally healed. I am still having some mild pain with sex &amp; tampons. I figured it would just heal eventually but after some gentle nudging from my therapist, I decided to pull the trigger on going to a pelvic PT. I already hit my deductible, why not.

I found an amazing PT and she did an internal exam that ended up being extremely painful. Turns out I have vaginismus (involuntary contraction of pelvic floor muscles) that likely started before pregnancy.

I am 35 and this is the first I am hearing of this. Pelvic exams have always been painful. I had my first one when I was ~14 (due to a period issue) with no prep from my mom. It was painful and I was so traumatized by the experience that I didn’t go again until my late 20’s. I cried during that exam and the GYN told me to go to a doctor for anxiety. Fast forward to pregnancy, and the pelvic exams and induction were SO painful, almost as painful as labor. I just keep having flashbacks to her pushing, with no painkillers and me crying.

This entire time I am thinking I am just ‘sensitive’. WTF.

Why did these doctors hurt me? Why didn’t ANY of them tell me that I have this condition or that I should go to a pelvic PT? Why weren’t they more gentle or why wasn’t I giving numbing agents and/or painkillers during exams? I was in so much shock yesterday that I didn’t think to ask the PT, so I emailed her last night asking how it’s possible that this happened. She responded back that some medical providers aren’t educated on what pelvic floor PT can do for their patients

I am so heartbroken that I have been treated like this and other women are probably going through the same thing. If I go to google right now (a predominately male driven company developing the search algorithms btw), and type in painful pelvic exam, every single result on the front page says exams are uncomfortable, not painful. Nothing about what to do if they are painful. I really wonder how many women are going through this right now and being told their pain is not real.

TLDR: Your pain is real. If exams (or tampons or sex) hurt, go to a good pelvic PT. Change your OBGYN if you can. This is unacceptable.

Note: I will add my entire PT experience in the comments incase other women want to learn more.",beyondthebump

1917,Teething signs?,"What are some signs you LO showed while teething? My son is 9mo and got his bottom teeth in a little over a month ago. He’s showing the normal signs of chewing excessively, especially on his hand, and drooling. The past few days he’s gotten pretty warm, but hasn’t had a real fever. All 3 days I gave him Tylenol, which has helped. So far today he has been a bit fussy and has only been up not even two hours and is already napping again. I’m thinking his top teeth are about to pop through but I’m not sure if these are normal symptoms with teething, just a bad day, or potentially getting sick.

He has gone through phases of constant chatter and babbling but earlier this week it’s pretty much come to a halt and the only noise he makes is this moaning/whining sound. I don’t even know the best way to describe it - it’s like an open mouth moan, like he’s straining with no actual vowel or consonant sounds. (I truly don’t want to be insensitive but the best way to describe it is like how a deaf person may sound if they tried talking.) His hearing seems fine, he responds to noises and smiles back at us. But I haven’t heard him laugh, coo, or babble in a few days. Has anyone else experienced this before?",beyondthebump
1919,Quick vent - so “sick” of being told I need to put my son in daycare to build his immunity and feeling shamed that he’s home with me right now.,"FTM to a 9 month old son. We currently aren’t enrolled in daycare because I am worried about COVID (yes, I still am). I understand the data shows that kids don’t get extremely ill, but I am still very concerned and have terrible anxiety about it.  Family has been helping us with childcare, and we also have flexible work schedules. Not saying it’s not hard to balance, because it is, but for right now that’s what I feel safest with so I’ll accept the inconveniences that come with it. 

I wholeheartedly support other parents for whatever childcare arrangements work best for their families. It’s honestly none of my business what other families decide to do. I have some friends that don’t have their kids in daycare, and then I have some friends that are very pro-daycare. Again, I don’t make comments to my friends about their childcare arrangements and I also don’t go around telling everyone why I have my son home and that I don’t feel comfortable with daycare right now despite typing it all out in this post LOL. I know it can be a touchy subject and I certainly want to be respectful. Just because I don’t have my son in daycare currently doesn’t mean that it’s “wrong” - it’s just what I am choosing what to do right now until he gets a little older. I don’t want other parents to think that by saying I’m keeping my son home that think their kids should be home, because thats not it. I honestly try to avoid the conversation entirely because I don’t like to feel judged and I don’t want others to think I’m judging them. 

One of my friends that is very pro-daycare (and by that, I mean she is constantly telling me all the benefits my son is missing out on by not attending) is now telling me that I’m doing a disservice to my son because he’s not building his immunity by going daycare and that he needs to get sick so he can strengthen his immune system. That I’m keeping him too sheltered. She makes such a big deal about the illness part of daycare. I hear about it all the time. Her son is a few months older than mine and is sick often (I totally understand this comes with daycare, this is not a criticism whatsoever) so she brings this up a lot - that he’s building his immunity and why wouldn’t I want to do the same for my son? 

Honestly, I’m just sick of listening to it. I don’t ask for this feedback but she is constantly reminding me. I get it - kids get sick. They are going to get sick when they start daycare, or school, or when they are with more people. I get that. It’s inevitable and part of life. Maybe I’m just jealous that my friend is finally in a headspace that she isn’t scared of covid like I am, but I don’t appreciate her comments because they imply that I’m doing something wrong and not making the best decisions for my son. Even if she is right about building their immune systems, I don’t appreciate the way she is delivering that info to me. 

So I just wanted some honest feedback on how you would handle this situation. I am not a confrontational person, I don’t have to be “right” - but I do think I want to gently say something to let her know my childcare choices aren’t up for debate and that it’s ok for us to parent differently. Just because he’s home right now doesn’t mean he isn’t going to strengthen his immune system someday. Like - I love you but you do you and I’ll do me, ok? LOL 

But really - so much love and respect to all of our childcare choices. It’s hard enough being a working parent, we don’t need added stress! ❤️",beyondthebump
1920,"Everyone says you will start to hate your pets and for me, it was true","Let me explain before you bring the pitchforks please. My cats are assholes. Surprising, right?

Our calico has cost us a few hundred dollars in nipples. She steals them and then chews the tips off, likely because they feel great on her teeth. Same with anything that material baby related, such as spoons and bowls and even some bathtub books. ""Well, why didn't you simply put them away?"" We would. She would wait for us to forget and then strike. It isn't that easy to forget to put them away after washing bottles for the millionth time that day and you're sleep deprived.

But wait, there's more! Our tiger kitty, Parmesan, has been extra clingy. She is always on your lap and then when you go to remove her, she digs her claws in. That isn't even the problem, she will jump into the baby bassinet any time baby is not there. So we change the sheets, we try to deter her with blankets on top, etc, nothing works. 

Then there's our sweet Jackson. He's still a doll. He hates the babies so any time the babies are out, he is nowhere to be found. He comes out during nap time, for food, and then gets all the cuddles at bedtime. He's fine. 

Just want to clarify, I love these little fur monsters. I am just exhausted from keeping three tiny humans alive and a bit maxed out on affection at the moment. I try to love on the cats with what I have left, they're great animals. They never signed up for this baby stuff, as far as they're concerned they are the babies still.",beyondthebump

We put him in daycare starting at 12 weeks, but this didn't really seem to make a difference in his attitude towards us. Over the past week I've noticed that he is really disinterested in us (mostly me). It's so much harder to get him to make eye contact and when he does my usual smiles/baby talk/silliness/mirrors/toys don't seem to make him happy at all. It's not even like he's unhappy necessarily, although he has been easier to piss off. It just makes me so sad because I look forward to his happy attitude.

I love my son too pieces and I'm so happy he is here in my arms but he does not seem like the same baby that was in my belly I cannot connect the two.

1923,At the in laws,"Why we decided to cut our stay short from five to three days, you ask?
MIL, how about you offer to hold my baby when she is crying while I am trying to eat or prep her food or go to the toilet; not exclusively demand her when she is happily on my arms? And don’t then hand her back annoyed as soon as you have made her cry. How about if you insist on feeding her mid-meal, you don‘t stop after 2 spoonful because it is annoying? And why do you keep yelling „eeek, so dirty!“ when she puts her hand in the food/on the spoon or drops something? Do you want her to be spoonfed until old age or think those screams will make her magically eat perfectally clean at 9 months?
BIL, how about you put your 1 year old in the bath and to bed earlier than 3 AM (!), if he is already screaming his head off for hours and hours? I heard he slept later than mine, but I thought maybe 10 PM or so!? And during the day, maybe try playing with him or reading a book once in a while instead of just playing constant loud videos 30cms in front of his face for hours? My LO is already stressed from just the annoying loud sound, are you sure your kid enjoys it? 

I would have loved some rest since everyday is so hard raising a kid with no support system, no friends near us, only me and my husband - my own family back in my home country is half the world away and no way to know when they will be able to come see their grandchild or we could visit thanks to Covid. But with no actual support during the day from family members and another baby crying for 8 hours at earpiercing noise after my own has finally finally slept is making me feel nothing but exhaustion. I slept one and a half hours tonight.

For our own mental health we decided to at least have the weekend at our own home before the next weekdays loom. Sorry not sorry.

1924,Trying to come to terms that my baby might be delayed and it is my fault.,"My son did not have oxygen for a long time and I had an appointment a few months ago with a gynaecologist that he may be delayed because of that factor. He is nearly 6 months and still doesn’t grasps for toys or anything really. I put it in his hand and he’ll hold it and then a few seconds later will let go. He does try to hold his bottle and he takes his dummy out of his mouth and passes to his other hand.. I know babies younger then him that will grasp for toys or anything really and are already on their way to crawl, he has a good head control and is able to push his body off the ground during tummy time. He has rolled once when he was younger and still doesn’t show signs of rolling. The reason why it is my fault is because I felt his movements slow down the night before and waited until the morning to go to the hospital. He was still moving but not like he usually did. I feel like if I went to the hospital straight away he would’ve been ok. He had to be resuscitated and the doctor said what happened to him was extremely rare because there was no sign of trauma (he just started bleeding) and didn’t move as often. I’m just getting this off my chest. I love my son with all my heart but I already felt like I failed as a mother even before he was born",beyondthebump

Since labor (Oct '19), I have nagging lower back pain that was labelled as normal. I went to the doctor many times because I thought I'm leaking fluid and wasn't sure it was urine or something else. Finally 2 weeks ago they let me go to a specialist. She told me the back pain is because of my pelvis muscles, they are either too loose or too stiffened, I have too less control about what my muscles want to do. I have lots of exercises to help regulate them more and I already feel a bit of relieve on my back! Didn't think it could come from those muscles.

We’ve read tons of great reviews, and looking back now, I’m sure they were all paid reviews. 

For how expensive the camera is, I’m surprised at how many errors there are with this device. 

There’s always troubleshooting problems with the camera which has us unplugging it every few days, sometimes at the most inconvenient time (napping). 

We received the 1 year free subscription to sleep analytics. What a scam. On multiple occasions, it didn’t capture the analytics because there wasn’t enough data (whatever that means). And on top of that, it’s inaccurate. We would look back at the nights and notice that it records inaccurate information. For example, it would say that we attended to the baby when the baby put themselves to sleep.

1933,It gets better ❤️,"Another one of these posts but, I really feel the need to share my experience.

I have had a very significant post partum anxiety (exacerbated by covid). There were days I wanted to die, wished we never had my sweet boy, days that I felt like marriage was falling apart and we were headed for divorce, panic attacks, fear that I would never have a ""normal"" life again and so on. In the first 2 months especially of my little guys life I really really struggled. 

After speaking to a therapist for several weeks, we decided that medication (cipralex) was the right next step for me. Slowly after starting the medication and continuing with therapy I began to enjoy my baby despite the lack of sleep and challenges with breastfeeding. 

6 months later I am living a life I never dreamt I could after he was first born.  The days are simple still, nothing too crazy, but we go on outings/walks, see friends, I am able to pickup groceries and prepare meals (both myself and my husband) and my relationship is stronger than it has been since before baby was here. We still have hard days but, I feel so much happiness in my life and can't believe how much joy my little boy brings.

I am not saying what I went through in terms of medication etc. is for everyone and I am so grateful I had access to therapy. I just want anyone who is struggling to know that it will get better and it is ok to ask for help. I also wanted to thank this subreddit for offering me advice during a very challenging time.

1934,Were you massaged with oil during labor and delivery or not at all and did you tear?,"I saw a comment of a mom who said her third birth was by far the easiest to recover from and was the only one she had a with a midwife and the only one where she was massaged with oil while giving birth. She said this was the only birth she had where she wasn’t as sore after and the only birth she had where she did not tear. This got me thinking. 

I assumed everyone was always massaged with oil while giving birth. Is this not true? If you were or weren’t was it with a midwife or OB? 

I had a midwife had an epidural in the end and pushed on my back while being massaged with oil the whole time. I delivered an 8lb 1oz baby girl with no tearing.

I saw some articles talking about colic-like symptoms and antibiotics for babys.

Our beautiful baby girl is 5 weeks old now and I still can't help but feel guilty that she isn't going to be breastfed, all the searching on the internet has left me feeling defeated by some of the comments regarding bottle fed babies, hell even the nurses at the hospital made a comment shaming mothers who don't breastfeed.

1946,I love my partner… but this hurt..,"So my partner (M 33) and I (F 27) have been together almost 5 years and we have a 4 month old son. He owns 2 businesses that he needs to do a lot of work for, he couldn’t even take a week off after our son was born and is back working 6-7 days a week, some days he’s gone for over 12 hours. Due to covid, he hasn’t been able to take much income and is working such long hours for almost nothing. It’s okay though because I have excellent maternity pay from my workplace that is able to support us at the moment. 

My son is the absolute light of my life, but he has been really difficult. He’s had issues with sleeping and feeding since he was born, reflux, intolerances and an undiagnosed tongue tie that we’ve only just had revised. My partner is really great when he is home and helps out a lot although I feel that the majority of responsibility lies with me. A lot of the time he will play with our son and then as soon as he starts fussing he will hand him over to me. Sometimes I feel myself getting snappy at him because I’m stressed and I try to apologise when I act that way, but I feel he gets to enjoy the fun part of parenting while I have to do the hard stuff. 
 We have minimal support where we live, our family are over 3 hours away and we don’t have many friends as we moved to our city in the peak of covid last year. A difficult baby coupled with a lot of time spent just me and my baby has lead me to develop some mild PPD and PPA. I’m currently seeing a psychologist for this. 

I saw my psychologist on Tuesday and told her that a lot of the time I hold in my feelings and emotions because my partner is already so stressed with work and other stuff (his brother is unwell and his mother passed last year) and I don’t want to add to his stress. She stated that I needed to express my feelings to my partner because we are in this together and he needs to support me, she also said I need to ask him to be more available because no one else can support me right now. 
I went home that evening and tried to chat with my partner. He took what I said as a massive criticism and said that he thinks he is doing enough and has nothing left to give me as he’s already got too much to worry about. In the end, I got him to agree to help out a bit with breastfeeding when he is home (like help burp and settle as our son struggles with reflux). But the next day as I fed our son, he decided to sit on his phone and then go for a run and didn’t help at all. 

I love him and he’s a great guy, I think he’s just really stressed with everything going on. Although I feel like I’m prioritised last in his life as when I asked for support he basically said no. This really hurt. I don’t really know what to do from here, I don’t want to add to his stress but I’m also struggling. I’m not sure I’m looking for answers here, I more just want to know that others have gone through rough patches and gotten through it?",beyondthebump

1948,8-week old has gotten super lazy on the boob.

1960,I dont really know what to do (long),"Two weeks ago I found out I was pregnant, now currently at 35 weeks. I had no idea, thinking about it now I was 'showing' but it was easy to shrug it off as just some belly fat (always carried my weight in the middle.) Ive also been on birth control for almost a year, the depo shot, so really pregnancy was never a thought at times I suppose I experienced symptoms. 

Even the doc who's been seeing me was  A. shocked how pregnant I was after the ultrasound and B. very surprised how she decided once we found her out that she didnt need to hide anymore- showing, moving, all the typical things I didnt have 2 weeks ago.

My due dates in a month, Im beyond scared. Im only 19 years old, was still 18 when my daughter was conceived. Ive terrified of ivs and giving blood, surgery. Whenever I thought of childbirth I was petrified and always told myself 10 years from now I might be able to handle it. 

The fact I have a mostly developed baby human in my stomach has not fully sunk in, if much at all. I feel disassociated most of the day. I feel like Im an imposter in my own body, maybe like all off a sudden a parasyte has taken over. Note, I feel *awful* knowing that Im talking about my unborn daughter.

I dont feel any real attachment, or motherly anything. I feel sorry for the girl, knowing if I had known way earlier that I was pregnant I wouldve had an abortion. I cant tell if Ive been getting sick from her or the thought of reality. 

Now, I'm also not keeping her. Im currently going through the adoption process to find her two wonderful parents who  would love her. Im far from ready to be a mother- I still live at home with my own parents and its not an environment I'd ever want to start my family in. Im not even close to having the means to leave, let alone in anyway prepared for a child too. I feel like I'm still one, not hardly an adult yet. Cant take care of myself, especially not a baby.

The father, is not around and I dont want him to be. He was a tinder fling I saw for about a month before I was clear he was a rather scary scumbag. I almost could say Im really quite embarassed to be having a child thats half his, it certainly doesnt make me feel good. I'd never trust him to raise a kid, especially not one thats half mine.

There is a couple Ive been shown that I really like, and so far seem like theyd be wonderful parents to this baby girl. Just, they want to discuss open adoption. I feel terrible for really just wanting her to go off to a good home and forget about all this thereafter. I mean, not like I could, but yea. I dont think I want to have a relationship with her, I feel like Ive forfeited my right to be a mother after all this, giving up my firstborn. I dont want her to know me, just her adoptive parents. I want her to grow up so happy and surrounded by love in their family she wont ever feel the need to find her birthmother.

I dont know how to feel about anything, I wake up each morning numb, feeling like I'm not real, this isnt real. I dont know what to do, I think this is something I might need a therapist for and might need one for a while.",beyondthebump

As the title says, my 15 month old barely eats. We did BLW with self feeding starting at 6 months and did 100+ foods before 1.

He has only gained about 10oz in 3 months and I’m not sure what else to do. I offer him variety with as much calories and fats as I can incorporate (butters, oil, cheese, yogurt, chia, avocado, etc.) but it doesn’t really help if he only eats 2 bites.

My cousins wedding is coming up. We’re desi and our weddings usually have multiple events and are typically nighttime affairs. I can’t miss the wedding and I can’t leave baby alone with anyone. (EBF and Co-sleeping). I have a lot of anxiety about this wedding ruining her routine. We have an event this weekend and then the following weekend.

During the day I allow her to do contact naps in the wrap. First stretch of nighttime sleep is in the crib (about 4 hours).

Has anyone had to experience anything like this? How did you maintain your kiddos routine? I except it to be somewhat disrupted but any advice is appreciated.


I plan to do my best to replicate her nighttime routine as much as possible (diaper change and pajamas at 8, nursing in a quiet room or the car. Then stroller with noise cancelling headphones). If she’s fussy, I will just wear her until we get home.

1966,11 month old sleeps a lot. How do I drop a nap?,"Hi all! My son is about to turn 1 in 9 days. He was born 6 weeks early and doing well overall. He's been pretty good with sleep the whole time. We haven't experienced any type of sleep regression, nor did we need to sleep train in any way. When he's tired, he just falls asleep. He started sleeping through the night (11 hours) around 4-5 months, and he still sleeps every night from 7:30p to 6am. I work from home so the need for a specific nap time wasn't an issue for me. I decided to just follow his cues and wing it. If I put him down for a scheduled nap when he wasn't ready, he would get pissed and want to go back to playing. So I just let him play around until he starts rubbing his eyes, then I put him down and he falls asleep within 5-10 mins. 

Although we don't have a set nap schedule, I've noticed his 3 naps are pretty consistent: morning nap around 8am, midday nap around 12-1p, and afternoon nap around 3-4p. His naps last 1-2 hours. I don't wake him up either. He's awake for 2-3 hours between naps and plays independently the majority of the time. This has been his routine since about 5-6 months old. 

I'm worried he's sleeping way too much and that I'm being too lax about his sleep structure. When he's awake he's very content and keeps himself busy without me needing to entertain him much.

My concern is that he starts daycare next month and they are open at 7:30am, with one nap time at 12pm, and close at 530p. Ideally I'd like to drop him off right at 7:30 or 8, when he usually gets ready for his first nap. I've been reading and it looks like he should've transitioned from 3 to 2 naps at 6-8 months. I'm trying to keep him awake longer before his morning nap, but the 8am nap is the one he seems to want the most (the one he gets really grumpy for). 

I'm just trying to make the transition to daycare a little less shocking for him, but not sure if 3.5 weeks until then is enough time to get him to drop his morning nap. Or should I try to get go to bed later so he wakes up later and doesn't need the 8am nap? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",beyondthebump

1978,Am I being selfish ?,"So my LO is 3 months old. I believe she is teething so she is going through a tough time. She is very attached to me but especially at night. She is breastfed and I do cosleep with her. I know it is controversial but it works for us. Me and her father don’t love together and we have burned some bridges and he can’t come to my house at all and at his house there are restrictions and so I cannot be there overnight. However, nights are when I need help. She is pretty easy during the day and I can generally keep up with her. But at night I am dog tired and I do not get consistent rest. At night she cries if I put her in her bassinet. She is fine with it in the day but she’s accustomed to me pulling her in bed at this point. She is a little under the weather and the teething is affecting her. She is a strong little girl and breaks out of her swaddles she also has a habit of flailing her body around and waking herself up. Before things got uncomfortable at our households I appreciated his overnight help sooooo much. I still do appreciate those moments. At night I never have energy but he’ll pop up walk her around and engage her so she tires herself out. 

I vent to him about me disliking this change. But I already knew he’d suggest me leaving her with him overnight. I don’t think I’m ready for that... more importantly I don’t think my LO is ready for that. We did it once so I could go out with a friend and she was hysterical for HOURS. INCONSOLABLE. I don’t want her feeling like that I don’t want her crying for hours missing her mommy or just seeking my comfort. His suggestions make sense if I wanted sleep but I don’t know how I could sleep worrying about my daughter. I know he’s her dad and I want her to comprehend that and feel comforted by him. I want to leave her with him more it’s just overnight feels like too much. Even from a pumping perspective I pump but I’m inconsistent and she hasn’t been good with bottles yet. I think it should be a transition towards that but truthfully I want it to be the 3 of us more. It feels like coparenting with the state of our relationship and households. I guess I should accept it for what it is right now but it’s really affecting my mental health not getting the help that I need.

1979,“Sleep when baby sleeps” - advice from people with easy babies?,"If I happen to mention to anyone that I am dangerously sleep deprived I hear “you should be sleeping when baby sleeps”. This assumes baby actually sleeps and/or will take naps during the day in a safe sleep space so I can nap too. He won’t.

My baby only seems to want to sleep on me during the day. If I put him in his bassinet or crib he will last maybe 30 mins, if I’m lucky. Often he starts fussing within 5-10 mins.

At night I go to sleep when he does, but he doesn’t do more than 3 hours at a time. Last night it was 3 hours, then awake every 45 mins after that. I would spend 15-20 mins shushing and rocking and soothing, only for him to sleep 45 mins. If it was time for him to feed it would take an hour of awake time for 45 mins of sleep time (his, not mine, because I can’t fall asleep immediately).

I've burned up all of my PTO leaving work early to get her, or calling off entirely. I'm falling way behind at work. My husband has only taken a few days off and even now, he's working while we're home and I have a raging sinus infection that is causing me so much pain I haven't slept for 2 days.

Our doctor said she has so much fluid behind her ears that she can't hear and will cause her to have speech delays and she's recommending ear tubes since we can't clear her sinuses. My daughter may need to get surgery because she won't let us clear her nose, it's so frustrating.

She won't let me dress her or change her diaper either. Dressing her and diaper changes take 15 minutes because she fights them. Screaming, scratching, it's so frustrating. Nothing makes her happy, she's miserable all the time and acts like we're trying to hurt her.

These aren't really cohesive thoughts, I'm in excruciating pain and have zero support right now and just need to vent.",beyondthebump
1982,Period 7 weeks PP? (pumping),"I stopped my PP bleeding at exactly six weeks. Tomorrow we’ll be 8 weeks and I think I just started my period because I’m bleeding again, mild cramping with back pain? I can barely feel anything to the point to say that it hurts.
I pump and bottle feed instead of breastfeeding because my baby was a NICU baby and is bottle lazy. He will stay latched for about two minutes before he lets go and starts crying. 
Is pumping and bottle feeding the reason why my period is back this early? Is it not the same as breastfeeding?",beyondthebump

1986,When did I become the guru?,"I'm back at work this week, and I was catching up with a coworker. He confided in me that he and his wife are expecting their own little one in several months, and he's kind of flying blind. He has one older son from a previous marriage, but he and his first wife were already on the outs when he was born, so he didn't really get to raise his oldest as a newborn.

As such, he asked me for any notes I might have about the early days after Junior is born, and folks, I must have talked for about 20 minutes straight, all with the caveat that I only know my own kid. I even noticed the time and was sure that Coworker had to get back on his assignment, but he said, very graciously: ""The wife and I need all the notes we can get, and I can tell you needed to talk about this.""

I knew I would want to share my experience, I just didn't realize it would be so soon!",beyondthebump
1987,Help me deal with my daughter's clear preference for her father,"For the first about 10 months of my 12-month-old's life, I was her primary caretaker while my husband worked at a demanding job. He left the job at about 10 months, and took on more care taking around the same time that I started to have to devote more time to major projects at work. For a little over a month now, my daughter has developed an obvious preference for her father. If I'm holding her and she sees him, she reaches out to him and she is very clearly happiest to see him. It feels especially rough because a) she isn't a super affectionate baby, and so I feel like I'm just sort of here; and b) she didn't have a clear preference for me when I was with her most of the time.

I am a FTM and had a baby relatively late in life, and I feel awful. Intellectually, I can talk myself through the fact that my husband plays with her more while I end up doing more logistical stuff (like packing lunches, making bottles, etc) and that it's objectively good that she has a strong bond with her father. But emotionally I can't shake the feeling that my baby doesn't like me. I have a therapist and talk to her about this, and so I know the things to tell myself, but I really struggle with feeling like a failure as a mother. I don't know anyone else who has gone through this.

I'm partly venting, but mostly asking for anything from more experienced parents or anyone else who has gone through anything at all like this. Will it change and/or get better? How have you dealt with something like this? Or do you even just have anything nice to say that will make me feel less awful?",beyondthebump
1988,Holy cluster feeding,"My 5 day old cluster feeds every night so far from day 2 til now, from 10pm to 6am, with almost no nap in between, just burping and changing diaper. Anyone else have cluster feeds this long? 

And WHY do none of the main newborn books mention cluster feeding?? This took us by surprise, we always thought they fed every 2-3 hours",beyondthebump

1990,Please teach me baby shower gift etiquette,"I tried to learn by reading online but it’s still confusing!
Please teach me baby shower etiquette especially regarding gifts. 

I’m invited to a baby shower (my own was canceled last year due to covid😭) and I have the link to her registry. 

There is a gift I’d like to buy from the list. Normally if there’s not gathering, I’d send the gift to the recipient. But if there’s a baby shower, do I send it to myself and bring it as a gift? Or do I send it to the recipient and she won’t open until the day of baby shower?",beyondthebump
1991,Pattern Obsession,"Is anyone else's LO's obsessed with patterns? My LO just turned 3 months, for the past two weeks or so anything with a pattern to it has just fascinated her. She will stare and talk to the nursing pillow, the wallpaper behind her changing table, t-shirts.... for ages! I've been narrating to her throughout outfit changes. Holding up the new articles for her to see before putting them on. Now we have to take chat breaks whenever something has a pattern to it 😆

I love seeing her world expand!",beyondthebump
1992,My wife is afraid that therapy will send her to the ward,"Lately she hasn’t been feeling herself because of the constant cycle of pumping and feeding, among other stressors like baby getting worse at latching. I’m also on leave so I try my best to help.

She has been to therapy before but she doesn’t want to see one now because she’s afraid if she tells them how she truly feels, her therapist will send her to a PPD ward. Is this really a case? How can a mother receive support without this looming factor?",beyondthebump

1994,Breastfeeding hanger,I need help. I knew that breastfeeding would cause some additional hunger but I am starving all. the. time. I think it’s ramped up again as baby is consuming more recently. I am thankful to have a great supply so that’s not an issue. I keep telling myself I’m going to “get back on track”‘with my eating and I have every intention of doing so. But it’s one of those situations where I start out great and then by the evening I become a vacuum because I’m so hungry. I don’t eat terribly by any means I just know I could do better. What is everyone else eating to keep the hanger at bay?,beyondthebump

Other third degree tear sufferers, how long did it take before you felt normal again down there?

1996,Baby LPT: diaper cream only works if the skin is dry before you put it on,"Diaper rash is caused by too much moisture being held against the skin for too long. Diaper cream works by creating a barrier to keep moisture off the skin (why it's also called 'barrier cream').  So for it to work, you need to let baby's skin dry off after taking off the old diaper, before putting on the cream and the new diaper.

In case anyone was wondering why I stand there blowing on my baby's butt like a dork for two minutes every time I change him if he's got nappy rash. A hair dryer would probably be more effective.",beyondthebump

1998,My friend put her finger on my baby's mouth! (Rant/vent),"My friend was trying to soothe my baby while I was eating. When I wasn't watching, she gave her her vitamin D drop (without asking if she had had her daily dose) in an effort to soothe her. I learned about it later that night through someone else whom she had told. Now it's 4am and I can't stop thinking about this and I'm becoming angrier and more paranoid each minute.

Why didn't she asked if it was okay to give MY baby her vitamin? Why? I was so close. Why didn't she just give me back my baby if she was struggling to handle her?

Apart from the risk of too much vitamin D, what really bothers me is that she introduced her finger in my baby's mouth. She exposed my baby to be bacterias.

Were her hands clean? What if my baby gets her cold from this? She's only 6 weeks old. My husband and I had asthma growing up, so I'm super worried she'll struggle with that too. What if she gets another disease from this? 

Also, will I ever be able to trust this person again with my baby? Will she expose my baby to other things without my approval?

Ugh I can't sleep now and can't talk to anyone right now. Thanks Reddit for letting me vent.",beyondthebump
1999,My kid is scared of pooping,"My 19 month old has been screaming every time she needs to poop. It started around when she was a year old. She clenches and holds it and screams and cries. I hold her and try to convince her to let it go. I figured out that switching her to fortified soy milk completely fixed any constipation she was experiencing. So it’s been at least 4 months since she’s had constipation; now she just holds it and cries like she’s scared and it breaks my heart every time. Even once she goes, she cries until she’s in a completely new diaper.
I’m thinking about getting her a potty but I’m nervous that making her sit on it to poop will cause her to be scared of the toilet.
Anyone have advice about this?",beyondthebump
