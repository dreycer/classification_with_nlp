(a bit long, TLDR at the bottom)

At my last appt, I opted for an elective induction at 39 weeks. Baby was measuring good, everything checked out, and quite frankly I was so damn sick of being pregnant. I had heard some horror stories with induction, so I was on the fence about it, but my SPD was so awful at that point that I just couldn't stand the thought of being pregnant any longer.

I checked into the hospital last Tuesday at 8pm, started on Pitocin at 9. From 9pm to 9am, I pretty much just hung out in my hospital bed, slept, played some Mario Party, and chatted with my husband. Contractions were annoying but not too bad, and throughout the night they became more regular.

My OB stopped by during the night and said that she planned to come by and break my waters before noon. Well, I guess my body didn't want to wait on her because around 9:30am my water broke on its own. I didn't feel a ""pop"" like I've heard some women do, and I didn't feel any urge to pee, I was just lying there and suddenly felt wet. I looked at my husband and said ""Uh, I think my water just broke"". He called the nurse into the room and she helped me sit up in the bed and it was like the floodgates to my poon just opened up. I was not prepared for how much there was! Bed was soaked, and I was leaving a trail as I waddled to the bathroom.

After cleaning up, I got back in bed and within 30 minutes I was starting to REALLY feel the contractions. THEY FCKIN SUCKED. It was like the ghost of all my past period cramps came back to haunt me with each contraction. Up to this point, I was pretty back and forth on whether I wanted an epidural (I had a lumbar puncture 4 years ago and I hated the experience, so the thought of a needle in my spine was not something I was excited about) but holy shit, 45 minutes of those contractions completely changed my mind. I wanted the epidural ASAFP.

Just a side note for anyone who is on the fence about getting an epidural, I just want to say that compared to the contractions, the epidural is a cakewalk. Also, we don't get any special medals or certificates for doing things naturally, so if you want to get through your delivery as painlessly as possible, I could not recommend the epidural enough. Within 30 minutes, I became just a fat, meaty puppet whose legs were being manhandled by medical staff anytime they needed to do a cervical check (side note, cervical checks were a fucking breeze after that epidural)

From 9:30am to 1pm, I was able to actually relax. If it weren't for the monitors, I would have had no idea I was even having contractions. My OB came in and they did one last cervical check and told me that it was time to start pushing. I started actively pushing around 1:15 and by 3:32 I had my baby girl in my arms. The delivery was such a surreal experience, it almost feels like a fever dream - everything went better than I could have expected and I walked away with a couple of 1st-degree tears. I have horrible anxiety and thought of every worst-case scenario leading up to the induction, but I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. From the time I checked into the hospital to holding my little girl was about 19.5 hours, which was much faster than I was expecting as a FTM who was being induced.

Being one week on the other side, my baby is the most perfect thing I've ever seen, and even though my husband and I now live in a constant state of exhaustion, I'm joyously overwhelmed :)

Only my mom and 1 of my brothers believe in the vaccine and only the 3 of us are vaccinated. Even during the height of covid my 4 other siblings continued life as usual barely following any precautions and just had the ""put it in gods hands"" philosophy. 

Because of this, i have opted out of being involved in holiday celebrations on my side of the family this year. I also said that i didn't want to bring my baby around period, because they don't believe in masks or vaccines. 

So my mom sent out a group text saying that when the baby comes, those who don't vax, mask And social distance can't come to her home,  because she wants her home to be a safer space for my baby. 

I never asked her to do that, never even mentioned it. I only said that i can't in good conscience bring my baby around.

The time period gestationally-speaking when my first pregnancy went sideways to a few weeks after I lost her, were absolutely anxiety-filled days during this pregnancy.

Okay ladies, bare with me as I‚Äôm a hot mess. I‚Äôm a few days over 21 weeks with my first baby. I work 12 hour overnight shifts as a RN, it‚Äôs summer and there are lots of vacationers on top of our normal census. Pretty much, no lunch breaks and constantly moving. 

Last Thursday I was three hours into my shift when I developed severe abdominal cramping and lower back pain. I checked into OB and ruled out pre-term labor and was told to follow up with my OB in the morning. So I did, she diagnosed me with a severe form of round ligament pain. 

She gave me a work note for this week, I was scheduled Monday-Wednesday. I called off yesterday and today so far. I guess I‚Äôm in denial for tomorrow. 

I‚Äôve noticed the pain is extremely bad more toward the afternoon/night. Of course that‚Äôs when I start my shifts. 

My OB informed me of the spinning babies website. I tried some of the stretches this morning which only left me with increased low back and increased round ligament pain. 

I guess I‚Äôm just so frustrated. I‚Äôm not used to not even being able to fold laundry, bend over, or even walk around. I‚Äôm sitting here bawling like the over emotional hormonal hot mess that I‚Äôve become. 

Is there any end in sight? Did any of you wonderful mommas/mommas to be find anything to help with this?

I work at a large university hospital that completely covers the cost of my pregnancy, no co pays. However, if that weren‚Äôt true I would not have chosen to have my baby through this hospital. 

I‚Äôve been bounced around a lot from my first visit. I saw an NP a couple for times and she switched practices, I saw another NP once but she was clearly brand new and had 0 answers to my question. I‚Äôve seen an OB for the past 3 visits but I haven‚Äôt spent more than probably 5 mins total with her. 

I‚Äôve had a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù pregnancy so I figured I don‚Äôt really need to spend a lot of time with a doctor. But this is my first baby and I‚Äôm rather clueless, also extremely anxious so I have a lot of (maybe dumb) questions. 

This last visit came after I had been very very sick for a week or so. I was getting better when I saw her, but still concerned. (Covid symptoms with a negative test). She blew me off really, was not interested in any further testing or medication. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs viral or bacterial and I need/needed antibiotics. She just told me to continue Tylenol if my fever came back. 

But I got sidetracked by that when she measured my belly and said it was too small. She said the baby may not be developing anymore. That of course sent me into a panic. Luckily I was able to schedule an ultrasound that same day, and the sonographer told me everything measured perfectly if not slightly ahead. 

Since then I‚Äôve been thinking of switching to my hospital‚Äôs midwife program. But I honestly don‚Äôt know that much about midwifery, the delivery, or the rest of the pregnancy process.

I asked him if he'd rather go out for a nice dinner instead and he said ""we could do that this weekend and take a trip next weekend then?"" But I feel like he doesn't get it.

Every time I go to the toilet I'm checking for spotting or any signs of labor. Last week at my 35/36 week checkup the doctor said it didn't look like I was going to be giving birth any time soon, but I'm not sure how quickly that could change.

I feel like he just has started to feel like time is running out and wants to do one last nice thing together, but I think he's leaving it a bit late and if he could be the one to plan it, book it, and drive us there that'd still be better, but if anything happens and we need to go to the hospital he'll be driving on an international permit he should have switched over ages ago.

I'm thinking if he really wants to go somewhere I'll limit the radius to somewhere within an hour to the hospital... But is that realistic? I know I could end up pregnant until 40/41 weeks if I'm not showing any signs right now, but I've never experienced birth so I'm not sure if I'll be giving myself enough time in case of an emergency and the whole thing makes me a bit nervous.

She got mad at me because I went on leave from work early because i was getting to stressed out. Mind you i have some money saved and realised if i wanted any help from the state i better not have an income when he's born so I get approved. I didnt quit I'm just on leave  I asked her to please not worry. I then told her she was stressing me out about telling me how I'm fucking myself over. Which no I'm not. I dont have a lot put back but this will help me get the help I need. She told me good that I reap what a sow. That I should have had my kids father wear a condom how I'm not giving my kid a chance at all. Mind you this woman has not checked on me through out my pregnancy. When I asked her 2 months ago to let me do one on my own or have my mom help she got mad. I told my whole family she would do this to me. They all told me I was over reacting. Well my blood pressure spiked to 158/100. I then told her she was stressing me out and what my BP was. She kept on. So then I told her she was being a bitch and to please not stress me out. She then cancled my shower which mind you she has not even made a Facebook event for let alone spent any money on it. Then I really got upset. My blood pressure hit 162/104. I had to go to the er. Where they told me I have the start of gestational hypertension... fucking great.

We went to her first doctor‚Äôs visit on July 26th but they were unable to see anything in the ultrasound. We are extremely frustrated with this office because the Dr. simply told us ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything‚Äù and just walked out of the room. We asked what was next and said she would suggest getting a vaginal ultrasound. We were worried so I called several imaging centers to see if anybody had a same day cancellation, for which we luckily found the following day, July 27th. We drove out an hour and a half and got all the internal imaging done. We confirmed they sent over the report to the doctor that same afternoon but we NEVER received a call back from the doctor‚Äôs office. We tried calling them twice and claimed they never received the report. We decided to get the report and get a second opinion, for which this doctor said everything looked okay but still to get a follow up ultrasound in two to three weeks. By the way, the ultrasound report at that point showed my wife had 5 weeks and 4 days. Well, today we went back to the original office to hopefully hear good news and and here‚Äôs exactly what happened‚Ä¶

When we arrive to the office, wife and I get roomed. I kid you not but we hear the doctor telling who we assume was a person she was training right outside our room door, ‚ÄúWith this patient we will let them know of two options, or possibilities of what may be occurring. Either it‚Äôs still too early in the pregnancy or to begin considering that she might be having a mis carriage soon.‚Äù How professional is this???

So in comes the doctor, and tells us exactly this but what really got me upset is the fact that she says ‚Äúwe can try to do another ultrasound at week 7 (which we already were). 

At that point I knew they NEVER bothered to even look at the report in fine detail for them to already know that this was week 7. When I called her out on it, she switched the whole story around saying that she meant to say 9 weeks. 

She was heavily trying to convince us that something is wrong. She didn‚Äôt even bother to TRY and do an external ultrasound. She suggested another vaginal ultrasound. They referred us to an imaging center but didn‚Äôt have anything available till September. At this point my wife and I both broke down in the car..

I then decided to take my wife to the ER because we felt we wanted to know for sure what was going on. Even the ER nurses couldn‚Äôt believe how our doctor was making these assumptions so cold heartedly. Specially because my wife hasn‚Äôt had any spotting or cramps. Nothing that indicates a mis carriage. 

They were able to perform the vaginal ultrasound at the ER and they also did blood work to see her HCG levels. Everything indicates that she still has 5 weeks and 5 days but no heartbeat. They told us maybe she‚Äôs probably still to early or it might be a possible mis carriage but they don‚Äôt know for sure. Honestly we really are expecting that the baby simply didn‚Äôt form. We have to go back in 3 days because they want to see if her HCG levels are either going up or down to give us the final definitive answer‚Ä¶ 

Just to any parents who are expecting;

I've been actively ttc for 7 months now. Since going off the pill in early Feb I have had consistent cycles of 27 days until this cycle. I am now 7 days late for my period and have had nothing but negative tests (First response - from different packs). I haven't had any symptoms of my period coming or pregnancy symptoms (although probably too early for that anyway) - only a little bit of mild cramping and sore-ish boobs. I usually experience major pain and soreness particularly in my thighs around the time of my period. I have read that some women sometimes skip their periods but there is usually an underlying reason (weight gain/loss, excercise, stress etc) but I haven't been doing anything different this cycle. I'm not sure when I ovulated as I have only just recently started temping. Although I did have lots of ewcm around cd16 that lasted for a day or two. My husband and I had sex every day of what I assumed was my fertility window this cycle. I'm just wondering if it's possible that I may be pregnant despite tests showing a negative result after being 7 days late? Has anyone else experienced this?

Every year we go on this vacation with my husbands dads side and for the most part‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fun. My husband really looks forward to it. Communication with this man has always been a challenge. 

But we come up with other family, like my husbands cousin. Whose 6.5 year old son cannot entertain himself, has no other kids to play with, has behavioral issues, drives my husbands father bonkers. And he won‚Äôt. Shut. Up. About it. Saying how bad his parents are, hollering at the kid, telling the kid to eat or he will go to bed, and complaining up and down. And it finally happened where he says to me and husband‚Ä¶ 

‚Äúif your kid comes out like that‚Äù‚Ä¶..


Pause. What would YOU have said at this moment? Because here‚Äôs where I need to know if I was out of line. 

Don‚Äôt. Poke. The overstimulated third trimester MAMA BEAR, SIR. 

this is where I decided to start setting my boundaries. I said ‚ÄúAND IF HE DOES, I DONT WANT TO HEAR A THING ABOUT IT!! Everyone is trying their best!‚Äù 

So then he gets immediately upset and storms off. My husband tries to talk to him but he goes into the bathroom and slams the door in his face and holes himself up in his room like a toddler. He pays for this vacation and I feel like I overstepped a line and don‚Äôt feel welcome anymore cuz I pissed off the host. 

I was just so SICK of him going on and on about this poor kid (when really?? He‚Äôs not that bad he just needs a damn play mate.) and I‚Äôm like I don‚Äôt want to hear anything about parenting from you! I‚Äôm stating right now that you‚Äôre not gonna boss me or my kid around!

Now I don‚Äôt want to bring my kid on this vacation at all if he‚Äôs gonna holler at my kid about his food, or get pissy and impatient about my 8 month old son crying next year!

Also I feel like my boyfriend is being forced into something he doesn‚Äôt actually want. I know he loves me and we are a strong couple but I just don‚Äôt see him as a dad at all and I know his idea of kids was a long time from now, so I feel I am ruining I don‚Äôt know like his selfish years but I don‚Äôt know.I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I'm not sure where to start this... all I know is that I've never been more terrified in my life. 

I went to the mall to make an exchange and decided to have coffee with a friend while there. Somewhere along the line a had to pee, so made a beeline for the restroom. Imagine my surprise and fear when I realize that my underwear is covered in blood.

Not spotting, just straight up blood, soaked all the way through my shorts. I was confused because I wasn't in any pain and I hadn't even felt anything at the time.

Thank the heavens I had my friend with me. She got me to the hospital in record time and kept me calm. 

It was over 3 HOURS before I was even triaged and another hour before I got back to the room. I sat in that waiting room alone (thanks covid /s) for hours, not knowing what was going on. Not knowing if I was ok or if baby was ok. I was bleeding so bad that it pooled in my wheelchair and leaked over the side a bit.

Anytime I coughed or hiccuped I could feel the blood gushing out after that. And of course that would send me I to another rou d of tears. It wasn't until I flagged down a nurse for the 4th time that I at least got to a bathroom and was able to clean up a bit.

I'm not upset with the staff, they were amazing for the most part. I'm upset with the situation and the feeling of helplessness  

I got even more upset when they wouldn't let me see the ultrasound (I understand why, again I'm not upset with them for it) and I tried not to cry. I'd been numb for awhile at this point. The poor lady doing the ultrasound took pity on me after she was done and showed me the monitor. Baby looked fine and had a strong heartbeat. Good news and I was relieved but still cautious. The dr needed to look everything over before I got any definitive information. 

I got admitted to a room and they finally let my husband back. He has been the best support I could have asked for and I am so very thankful he was with me.

It took another hour for the dr to get back to me and even then they weren't sure what caused the bleeding, but the baby is fine and in good health. They had to check to make sure that my cervix is closed, which it seems fine as of now. I passed quite few blood clots, one that was bigger than my hand and had a few more that was blocking my cervix so that was fun. And apparently I managed to get a UTI, which (thankfully) I can't even feel. They sent me home with new meds and an order for bed rest.

I already have an OB appointment on Thurs but I'm gonna call tomorrow and see if they can see me earlier.

I just... I feel relieved but also scared? I really thought I lost my baby and I'm still terrified I might. I'm only 16 weeks, 17 on Wed. I don't know how I'm gonna be able to relax after this.

If you're still with me, thanks for reading. I just needed to vent a bit.

Now, I don't even *like* froot loops, but all pregnancy I've been craving it like it's some sort of nectar of the gods. So today I put myself a bowl of froot loops and start questioning life's biggest secrets, like ""why froot loops? I don't even like the taste of these but damned if it isn't satisfying!"" Or ""I wonder if it's going to rain today... it sure is cloudy out there."" All is right in the world, it's a cool breezy summer day with the promise of rain, my husband quietly working, and I get to settle in for some TV for the morning. 

An hour later it's time for me to check my glucose, and I get up to move and that's when my happy morning comes crashing down. Suddenly my head is swimming, the world is spinning, I'm on fire! Something is terribly wrong. I checked my sugars, they're suspiciously perfect after a bowl of sugar loops.... 

Next my ass is threatening to become a firehose of gross, so I try to bolt to the toilet, but the sudden wave of nausea assaults me! Never the less I manage to make it all the way to the bathroom, with the help of my steadfast walls, that is. I just make it in time to the toilet for my ass to erupt its disgusting dam of not chocolate all over the bowl. 

As I'm pushing out the last of it, without warning, my throat opens and I am now a volcano of froot loops! Half digested froot loops cover my bathmat, floor and my lower half. And I cried tears of pain and loss of my frooty sugar cereal.  

My sweet husband hears my cries and after seeing my volcano art, remarks how I managed to get the walls, tub, and myself in one go. Impressed he laments ""I'm going to have to clean that up aren't I?"" I sob out that I'm taking a shower, and I am so sorry for the mess.

After the shower, I manage to fall onto our bed and I cried. I cried that I left the mess for my husband, I cried that I lost my froot loops, I cried that I don't know if I can ever eat them again.

I had my first midwife appointment (10weeks) today at a local health clinic. I was nervous but slightly excited as a FTM (UK) starting my pregnancy journey, especially as I've experienced 2 early miscarriages this year. 

I knew it would just be a 'getting to know you' type appointment but I thought I'd get some advice on how to combat the horrendous morning sickness (more like 24/7 sickness), anxiety and some other medical issues

At first I thought the midwife seemed nice enough but as the appointment went on my feelings changed. Throughout, she kept saying how she's going to fill out as little health information as she can about me as it takes too long. She didn't take any blood or urine as she 'forgot' the various containers. It seemed to inconvenience her when I explained my various health issues which could make my pregnancy a bit more challenging. 
Once I mentioned my previous unsuccessful pregnancies, she kept referring back to them saying ""ah yes you were pregnant but of course have no children"" in a jokey way which touched a still raw nerve. 

In the end I came out feeling the most stressed I've felt so far, in the dark and not taken seriously. 

This isn't how I expected to be treated and I'm quite upset about it all.

Ive started tracking my braxton hicks and they alternate between 4 and 6 minutes. No back pain. I called my OB and the nurse went over what to expect for real contractions.

For the last 60 hours or so, I‚Äôve had constant pain below my bust line (maybe half an inch below where bras end) on my right side and is about 4 inches long. It‚Äôs gotten progressively worse particularly in the past 24 hours.

I would say that the pain is stabbing/burning in nature and feels like day 2 or 3 after one has stitches and stretched the wrong way. I wouldn‚Äôt personally consider this ‚Äúsevere pain‚Äù compared to ‚Äúsevere discomfort.‚Äù

That said, I couldn‚Äôt sleep well last night (2-3 hours) due to the discomfort. I have tried stretching, yoga, showers, walking, etc and nothing alleviated the pain (though some activities exasperated it). Baby is moving like normal, and her movements don‚Äôt impact the pressure at all.

Googling the symptoms say to see your dr/get to the ER immediately. When I called this morning (3.5 hours ago) the nurse didn‚Äôt seem concerned but said she would check with the doctor and call me back. Of course she hasn‚Äôt yet.

We know stress is impossible to avoid completely, but then there‚Äôs intentional stress, such as watching a scary movie. I understand that a scare gives a jolt of adrenaline, and that stress causes your body to release cortisol into the bloodstream, which then reaches the baby through the placenta, which *could* negatively affect the growth and physical development.

It‚Äôs an interesting concept, the affects of unavoidable stress, such as a loss, or a high pressure job, versus ‚Äòintentional‚Äô stress, such as a scary movie or intense video game. I don‚Äôt really like horror movies, but I do enjoy suspense. Sometimes we‚Äôll watch creepy documentaries, or play a fast paced video game which would certainly drive up my adrenaline level.

I graduated! 38+6 Perfect everything
***Really*** long story ahead because I babble.

So I gave birth about a month ago on the 12th of July to the freaking cutest little girl ever and it was probably the best thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. Plus now I can‚Äôt stop looking at her and holding her and sniffing her head. I‚Äôm constantly just saying ‚ÄúI love this baby!‚Äù to my boyfriend, my family and to myself when I‚Äôm alone with her. I just freaking love this baby.

So, I had a fairly uncomplicated but miserable pregnancy but was considered high risk because of my mental health and also the drugs I was/am on for it (lamictal, desvenlafaxine, plus later on Wellbutrin and then nixed the Wellbutrin because I got worse and added abilify instead). A little back story-
I found out I was pregnant a month after a miscarriage from an accidental pregnancy that I considered terminating as I never wanted kids, never wanted to date men and had been with my first ever boyfriend for about 9 months. Talk about a whirlwind! After the miscarriage I snapped a little and kind of tried/hoped to get pregnant again, and immediately did. Mental health still sucked and again i considered terminating all the way up to 12 or so weeks and cried everyday/was suicidal. Basically wanted to kill myself for the first two trimesters and couldn‚Äôt work due to intense vomiting, fatigue, rage, pubis symphysis disfunction and general hatred of life. I went to the ER on Christmas Eve Eve for my mental health and was considered high risk after that. Also I was anemic the whole pregnancy which didn‚Äôt help my mental health (iron deficiency itself can make you depressed. I had no idea and that was a HUGE part of why my pregnancy was so miserable). I basically stopped working my job the day of my positive test because I was already walloped with all of these terrible symptoms before I was even sure I was pregnant. 

Anyway! I told my boyfriend early on in the pregnancy that labor would be easy compared to all this and he had me repeat it for the camera so that I could rue myself and laugh at myself during the pain of labor when I was supposed to regret saying such a thing. But as I suspected, I was right!
Labor was amazing. Painful, but brilliant. 
So! The real story:

After wanting to be done being pregnant the whole time and actually mentally willing the universe to make me deliver prematurely, I made it all the way to 38 and six! On the 11th, i had a ton of mucus (though I think I had lost my mucus plug mostly already around 36 weeks) and then my bloody show. I spent the day shopping with my mom and got dressed in nice clothes figuring the universe would make me go into labor if I appeared not ready for it. Around 5 pm I had my first actual contraction that I could tell was just different from everything that I had wondered about before it. It was so cool. I called my sister in New York and told her it was gonna happen and she hopped a train and came the six or so hours ASAP. By eight o‚Äôclock at night I was having a painful but not terrible contraction about every hour. At ten o‚Äôclock my boyfriend and I had a hilarious kitchen disaster and I spent an hour with him cleaning up a horrible mess (he‚Äôs a butcher and taxidermist, use your imagination and the truth is probably grosser than what you‚Äôre thinking). It helped my contractions get going and then I decided to vacuum the apartment and sew beads onto a craft I had been working on and repack my hospital bag. Finally I got into bed when the contractions were about 20 minutes apart at 2 in the morning. 
I didn‚Äôt sleep at all as they got too painful to sleep through and I got up and took a shower. An hour later and they were about 10-15 minutes apart and I took another shower. At this point I felt incredibly constipated but like I was going to have diarrhea so I was alternating between being on the toilet for five minutes and then having a contraction and then going back to the toilet. Around 5 or 6 am I took another shower and then spent an hour on the toilet with my feet up on a stool, watching the rain and contracting and feeling like my intestines were trying to kill me. So far so good! 
Around nine AM I woke my boyfriend up to tell him that I was going to call the midwife in an hour or so and see what she said (contractions were about 6 minutes apart maybe), and to tell him it was nine so the insurance company was open and he could make some phone calls now before we had to drive to the hospital, to get our car legal again. ü§™
At 11 am or so my contractions were about three to four minutes apart, I was on the floor on my hands and knees through them, and our dog needed to go out so I got her leashed up because my boyfriend was outside on the phone with insurance and I knew we needed to leave for the hospital imminently so I had to take care of her right then. Boyfriend came back in, stopped me from walking her, did the job quickly and then we left for the hospital. Most horrible five minute ride ever. I couldn‚Äôt belt in and was arched up in the car. There was no parking anywhere close but I didn‚Äôt want to be dropped at the door or do valet (social anxiety) so we parked way away, and I finished a contraction in the car and we made it into the building before the next one hit. I got admitted quickly and they checked my cervix and I was 6 cm dilated! Hurrah!
I was worried I might not be progressing and they would send me away. Haha. Nope! 
I called my family and my mom and sister joined my boyfriend and I. Finally I asked for nitrous and it was doing nothing so a little while later we moved to the birthing tub. It was like the tub in the prefects bathroom in Harry Potter. Spigots and buttons galore. It was amazing and contractions were a lot more bearable with the intense bubbles going and the loudness drowning out my focus on the pain. My sister ran the tub controls, and I squeezed my boyfriends hands and my mom took video and we all had a gay old time, laughing and telling stories and being excited. Eventually I decided to go back to the room to try the nitrous again instead. When we got back to the room I said I think I needed to be checked again and what do you know, I was 9 cm dilated. In comes the obstetrician! She tells me I‚Äôve been using the nitrous mask wrong. üòÇ Oops! I got it sorted after that and it was definitely more helpful once I was actually getting it in my system. It doesn‚Äôt really touch the pain though, just makes you kind of far away and loopy feeling, but the contractions were still intense. I actually kind of liked the contractions because they were so intensely painful for about thirty seconds but then the pain decreased for the last thirty seconds of them so I knew the blessed amazing feeling of relief was coming each time. And the feeling of relief was like an intense drug high. So good that the contractions were worth the pain for the wonderful feeling of the pain going away. It‚Äôs kind of weird to explain. 
ANYWAY. 

Soon enough I was told to push and my boyfriend held one leg while I and a nurse held the other. I wish the nurse had held it completely because I just didn‚Äôt have the strength to hold back my own leg. It exhausted me so much I could hardly think about pushing. But pushing was great! Not painful like the contractions, just hard physically work. I felt like Sysiphus pushing the rock up the hill. It was exhausting. This is when I finally got to the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it‚Äù stage. I mean, I knew I could but I just felt like if someone could give me 30 seconds to catch my breath and leave me alone then I would be able to do it but I just needed a moment to myself. Obviously I couldn‚Äôt stop time and get that. Meanwhile my boyfriend was clenching my hand as I clenched his, my mom was sobbing and laughing, and my sister was shouting ‚Äúone more!‚Äù And ‚Äúyou‚Äôre almost there,‚Äù like she was my boxing coach. 
I should note that only two people were allowed in the birthing room but my medical team liked my family and loved how happy and laughing we all were and how chill and how much fun we were having so they let everyone stay. Hurray! After two pushes (I think) they brought out the olive oil (‚Äúnot virgin!‚Äù my boyfriend joked, causing the nurses and obstetricians to snort with laughter), and the obstetrician tried to work her fingers around my crowning baby‚Äôs head. At this point I was exhausted and making the stereotypical ‚Äúaaaaarrrrrgghhh!!‚Äù noises with each push. I think at this point they broke my water and it felt marginally easier and better. Some amount of relief of pressure but still everything was tremendous and I was in another world. To encourage me I think, I was asked if I wanted to touch her head, maybe after the next push. I said no. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt want to, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt think I was physically capable of the strength to reach down and touch her. I think I gave another push before the obstetrician decided to do an episiotomy. She was so calm and gentle and discrete with it. I think she said she was going to do it, but didn‚Äôt say much so I didn‚Äôt have time (or strength!) to be afraid or worried. One more push, (probably ten minutes total) and out came my girl. Cue cheering and yelling and sobbing. I vaguely remember pushing out my placenta but I was more focused on my baby who they placed on my belly. Within seconds she had crawled to my breast, grabbed my necklace with one hand and my boyfriend‚Äôs finger with the other, and ravenously latched on to my breast. Perfect latch. Immediately breastfeeding. Perfect baby. Absolute relief. 
It was honestly the best experience of my life. The adrenaline was amazing. I think the first thing I said then was to my boyfriend, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this again.‚Äù 
My sister later called me a ‚Äúbirth adrenaline junkie.‚Äù It was amazing. I felt so good. 

I‚Äôm about four weeks post partum now and the bleeding has mostly stopped and I‚Äôm not super sore any more. The first week or so was rough physically but at four days post partum I was able to take my baby to visit my work and meet my coworkers. I wasn‚Äôt going bed ridden at all after the first two days which I spent in the hospital. All in all, it‚Äôs been fabulous. 
I was on a high for the first ten days or so, and now I think I might be starting to deal with some post partum depression but I‚Äôm not sure yet. I‚Äôm very sensitive to hormone fluctuations so it‚Äôs hard to say if it will last. But holy cow, I love this baby. Sleep is rough some nights and great others. It‚Äôs a crapshoot. Some days she is attached to my breast nonstop and I can‚Äôt do anything and other days she naps so long I have to be the one to wake *her* up to get her to eat.

I am not used to having much conflicting plans, and I scheduled a visit to my grandparents after the fact (I want to tell them in person I am pregnant, and they're busy people, only being open on some tuesdays for the week). I thought my appointment was for today, but I only realized on Saturday it's schdeuled for the middle of the day tomorrow when I will be out...

So I rescheduled. I could have had it for a week from now, but earlier than I would prefer, so it couldn't be schdeuled until September 7th! That's like three weeks away. I wondered how it would work when I need an appointment every two weeks, then every week since there are little to no openings within two weeks. I figured I would have to schedule multiple appointments in a row, at least when my appointments are every two weeks.

My sister's almost girlfriend needs to see an ob for an emergency (she has cysts on her ovaries, and she doesn't know how big they are), and she couldn't be scheduled for a long time, she's going to have to have waited three weeks, and apparently the size of the cysts will determine if she just needs birth control for them to go away, or surgery, so each day passes is precious time! She called clinics within a forty five minute radius, and no one can take her earlier! I really think there should be app openings for emergencies. She had already gone to the emergency room, and they couldn't really do anything for her.

Trigger: Postpartum hemorrhaging


I woke up at 5am at 41weeks with a bit of blood in my urine and some vague period like pains. I thought it was my bloody show so hoped it meant labor would start soon. But the blood kind of kept trickling so I ended up going to the hospital at 6am to make sure everything was ok even though my water hadnt broken nor did I have any contractions.

I was monitored for awhile then had an echo just to check at around 10am - the dr immediately said I needed to induce because I had almost no amniotic fluid (Oligohydramnios). I had been checked at 40 weeks and had plenty.

So my husband came in with our bags and I was in a delivery room at 11am. The midwife did a sweep and ruptured my membranes to see if labor would start. I stayed at 2cm until 2:30pm (I had been at 2cm since my 40wk appt so doesnt mean much) and I had light contractions every 10 mins or so. So they gave me pitocin around 2:45 since they were afraid of delaying too much.

I was not prepared at all for this - I immediately started fast and painful contractions, like 100x worse than what I just had, and I started vomiting all over myself. Since I hadnt eaten it was just awful, like saliva vomit... then to top it off I shit all over too. I thought in that moment I really just couldnt do it, I just hoped I would pass out and not have to deal with anything. I also had a fever and they were worried I was sick so did some blood tests (later found out all negative so dont know why the fever happened). My husband asked for the epidural thank god because I was so out of it. 

I had the epidural at around 3:30 I think - not very painful to get put in, just some weird  pressure and a bit of sparking pain on the left of my back. But honestly I felt the IV/perfusion thing in my wrist hurt just as bad. I felt a lot better within just 10 mins and by 30 mins the contractions were completely manageable. I still had some vomiting and I also had violent cold chills/shaking even though my temperature was 39c.

I was much more comfortable and was able to manage contractions without losing control of my lower body too much (I could feel and move my legs but not stand, could clearly feel the contractions but the pain wasn‚Äôt overwhelming). I labored 2 hours only and was 10 cm at 530. I had to wait then to see if the baby would descend and engage because she was still too high. So I had to move to some different positions with my legs and lowering my butt and stuff. They gave me a 2 hour deadline - either she engaged or it would be a c section. 

Thankfully she engaged about an hour later, and was birthed within 30 mins of pushing. The pushing was hard, it wasnt that painful exactly but it felt impossible to push her out, but it happened! I followed the midwifes cues and my husband was great for cheering me on and stuff.

Right after she was born I knew something had gone a bit wrong because the tension in the room skyrocketed and a surgeon and 3 other nurses/assistants came in. There were like 8 or 9 people in the small room. My daughter was perfect, she was on me and so special so I wasnt nervous and didnt really follow what was happening. My husband was super worried but reassuring. I realize later I had a bad tear plus hemorrhaging from my uterus and they were trying to stop the bleeding. I spent almost an hour with then sewing and pushing stuff down there that didnt hurt but felt very awkward. Finally they were done, I had some vision difficulties and felt super weak for a bit but didnt need a blood transfusion in the end. They had me on IV antibiotics the whole birth because of my fever. I stayed in the delivery room almost 3 more hours to be monitored before moving to a recovery room (I didnt stand up though until early the next morning)


All in all it was tough but overall positive, my daughter is perfect. I feel pretty good 3 weeks later but still have pain, but I can walk around almost like normal so it isn‚Äôt too bad. I was in the hospital 4 nights.

Honestly the worst thing about the whole thing has been learning to breastfeed. I find it incredibly hard and only feel now that I have any sort of grasp on it. It sucks so much to see your baby scream for food and you are screaming inside to give it to them but you cant get it to work properly. I wish I had prepared more for that than for the birth itself which I felt I could have just completely left in the hands of the midwife and doctor. But we are managing it now so I am happy about that even though I have decided that if it continued to be too painful and difficult after another week to switch to formula.

TW: mention of miscarriage, and past abuse

I know this is not 100% pregnancy related and I hope it‚Äôs allowed, but I‚Äôm 29 weeks today with a baby boy, and have a situation with my MIL that‚Äôs stressing me out. I don‚Äôt have any close friends aside from my partner due to a lot of life changes in the past few years, so I don‚Äôt have anyone outside of the situation to vent to. This group has always been so supportive, so I thought it would be good to come here. I‚Äôm honestly just looking to vent and for some positive vibes to be sent my way.

Some relevant backstory: I (26f) grew up with narcissistic and abusive parents, a sister who followed their path of passing on trauma to others, and a slew of relatives that were the same and/or supported their behavior. I loved them (still do tbh) and tried over and over to heal my relationships with them despite horrendous things they did. It changed when I was pregnant with my first son with my ex husband (not current partner) 5 years ago and realized that not only were these people not going to change, but I couldn‚Äôt allow them to hurt my child the way they hurt me. I went no contact, and for the most part stayed that way.

Fast forward a bit: My partner (30M) and I were living together, and going to technical school. A bunch of financial issues hit us and we ended up having to give our apartment up if we wanted to keep going to school, and I was financially supporting my son who was with his father during the week. My partner and I ended up moving to his parents house for that time, and we were extremely grateful. As time went on though, it became obvious that my partners relatives, particularly his mom, were very much like my biological family. Manipulative, controlling, invasive, verbally abusive, with no respect for or even concept of boundaries. His mother was/is very possessive of him (he‚Äôs the youngest), to the point when we had our apartment she acted like he still lived with her and like we were playing pretend or something. Constantly asking him if he was ‚Äúcoming home tonight‚Äù, and always calling him when he wasn‚Äôt there like a teenager out past curfew.

I ended up having an unexpected pregnancy when we were there, and she was the only one we told. She was outright horrible to me, malicious even, to the point of triggering anxiety attacks when she walked in the room. When we were alone she would say sick things like how when she had a baby she forced herself to miscarry in the bathroom because she didn‚Äôt want it, and hint to me that I should do the same. We lost the pregnancy at ten weeks, and she outright said it was basically what god wanted. They weren‚Äôt words of comfort, they were more of an ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù We knew our situation wasn‚Äôt perfect but we just wanted our baby.

We wanted so badly to leave, and we were working our tails off. Covid threw a wrench in everything and I lost my job, which held us back. Finally though, we got out. We moved back to the town my son is in so we could be there more now that we graduated. My partners parents literally threw a fit that we were leaving.

I ended up going no contact with her, for my well being and my sons. My partner has been very understanding and respectful of that choice. And I‚Äôve been respectful and understanding of him wanting to keep a connection with his parents (though I cautioned him to set boundaries). 

I know he has been trying, and I‚Äôm proud of his efforts, but he has such a hard time standing up to his mother. He tends to sugarcoat things with her when confronting her, and tries so hard to avoid hurting her feelings (though she has no regard for his). She is the type of person that if you give a centimeter she will bulldoze over you and your boundaries, and justify it with ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm his mother.‚Äù I‚Äôve been warning him that while I know he doesn‚Äôt want a fight or a ‚Äúblow up‚Äù event, if he doesn‚Äôt be more firm with her things WILL blow up. 

That brings us to now. We are 29 weeks today with a baby boy, (he hasn‚Äôt told his parents because we decide that at least for now that‚Äôs what‚Äôs best) and we have my almost five year old son living with us. 

My partners mother (and father too) still is stuck in her ways. Thankfully there‚Äôs about a three hour drive between us and them, so that helps a bit. But, she still doesn‚Äôt respect his boundaries. Calls him several times in a row when he‚Äôs at work, and yells at him or throws a fit when he doesn‚Äôt answer the phone, for example. He tells her to stop, she listens for a week or two and is back at it again. She doesn‚Äôt take him seriously.

Remember the ‚Äúblow up‚Äù I‚Äôve been warning my partner about? It happened yesterday. About two weeks ago, his mom called and told him his aunt (who also lived with his parents and us, and was cruel to us both) is getting married and invited us to the wedding. He politely said no and for numerous reasons including covid(they live in a large city), he wasn‚Äôt going. She tried to bully him into going and again. He said no thank you.

She ended up sending him a photo of the invitation, probably as a guilt trip, and he just decided not to respond to that. No calls or texts from her or his father for two weeks, which he thought was weird but chalked it up to them being angry he said no. 

Yesterday he gets a text, from his mother saying that if he doesn‚Äôt respond to her she‚Äôs calling the police and filing a missing persons report. For emphasis. He is 30 years old, said no to an invitation, and didn‚Äôt respond to a photo message after she kept badgering him to go.

Not only did she do this, but she‚Äôs caused a ruckus with his sisters who live on the other side of the country and honestly don‚Äôt talk to him much. They take everything his mom says at face value because he‚Äôs the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù of the family. He was getting phone calls from them at 11:00 at night when we and our son are sleeping probably because they thought he was missing. 

I told him that he has to do something, and he agrees. No sugar coating, no playing nice. He‚Äôs going to confront her today, after work. This is totally out of hand. If this is how she acts now over something like this, imagine if/when she finds out I‚Äôm pregnant? 

I wish he didn‚Äôt have to go through this. Seeing him hurting like this is the worst. And honestly, it‚Äôs like reliving the experience with my relatives all over again, while pregnant and caring for my son.

It‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôve done everything I can. I‚Äôm the kind of person who sees a problem, and I make a plan and take action. But standing up to this woman and making some hard decisions is something he needs to do. In the past I‚Äôve stood up to her, but it was useless because she only saw me as the girl trying to steal her baby boy from her. I can‚Äôt do it for him this time, and doing nothing is sometimes the hardest thing to do.

Sex: Male  
 A few days ago one morning, I was in the shower. I was washing as usual but the friction of my wash rag and my nether region unexpectedly caused for an erection. At the moment, I figured ""why not"" and handled it there. As I finished I noticed some of my ejaculate had reached the various lotion bottles. I instantly decided to wash ALL of the bottles off as it was hard for me to tell which ones had semen on them through the steam from the shower. However, before I could wash the last one, one of my family members asked me a question through the door which distracted me and caused me to forget. About 10-15 minutes later I finished my shower and had started drying off when it hit me, ""oh wait, that yellow bottle"", but before I could wash it my older (20+) sister had walked into the bathroom to take a shower. After she was done I casually walked in as if I was going to go to the bathroom. I checked the bottle and it was something called ""Vagisil daily intimate wash"". I don't know exactly what an ""intimate wash"" (sounds like masturbation for girls or something) is or what Vagisil is, but it didn't look like soap so I'm not sure if the sperm would have survived or not. My family leaves the lids of all the bottles in the bathroom completely off at all times, and considering the position of which the Vagisil was at when it *happened* it may be possible that semen may have even entered the bottle.

Since that day (three days ago), I've hardly been able to sleep or eat. I am terrified as to what might happen. Especially since this morning as I was about to use the bathroom, my sister had just left the bathroom and had left a smell, similar but maybe different to that of a regular period (which I have heard is common in early pregnancy. I don't know if i'm just scaring myself and over thinking or of I'm naturally being rationally worried of even a slight possibility. As for my sister, she's been acting normal. So far she's the same groggy, gloomy, short fused, person as always, but I am beyond scared of the future at the moment and its all I've been able to think of.

I noticed it a few days after having my first, I'm very positive my epidural was placed horribly wrong as I have much worse back pain than before my first pregnancy last year. It also felt like there was too much pressure on the left side of my spine when they inserted it. 

My back still is giving me issues. I couldn't even change my first son's diaper for months without laying on my side as it would cause excruciating pain to spike through my back starting at the epidural site. I still can barely change his diapers sitting up or standing if I have to lean just that slight bit forward like you do to change diapers. Not even a changing table helped. 

It's almost 1 year since and I'm terrified I'll have to get another epidural as my first was sunny side up and I had no idea nor did any medical professionals try to flip him. Now my second son is also sunny side up, stubbornly head down and hanging out low just like his brother.

I'm 36 weeks (first baby) and up until the last couple of weeks I've had a really easy, happy pregnancy. My husband is amazing and takes great care of me.

He has some auto immune conditions which has made our decision to have a baby really difficult and we put it off for years because he never had a period of good health that lasted long enough for us to feel confident to try.

The last 2 years he's been really well (for him!) so we decided we'd start trying and got pregnant really quickly üòä

He's just had a major relapse and has spent the last 5 weeks or so quite unwell. He's battled though, and tried not to show it too much I think because he doesn't want to stress me out but I can tell.

He's been so unwell the last couple of days that he's not really gotten out of bed and I just feel so sad for him. I'm really stressed that he won't be well enough to be at the birth of our baby, or if he is, he'll really struggle to cope a I'll be more stressed about looking after him that the whole experience will be forever tainted.

I just want us to be able to enjoy this 1 moment together without having it overshadowed with poor health issues, like everything else we've done got the past 10 years has been üòî

I'm also really stressed about having to give birth on my own if he can't come. I don't have anyone else that I'd want to be there. I know he will do everything he can to be there, to support me and not let me stress about him but I can't help it. I love him and just want him to enjoy this moment without feeling like shit. 

I know a lot of this is hormone driven right now, but I'm so sad about it all. Its also my birthday today and I'm sat at home alone while he's stuck in bed so feeling extra sorry for myself!

Guys, I legit was taking notes while in labor just so I could write this up. I loved super detailed stories and here is mine!

Baby was born ON HIS DUE DATE 08/11/21. Statistics are that 4-5% of babies actually come on their due date, such a punctual kid already. I had an induction scheduled for the day after his due date and was trying to figure out how to kill one more day. I went to get a COVID test for the induction, stopped at Michael's to look at their Halloween stuff and stopped by PetSmart picking up a new wire crate and treats for my pups. We also went to Costco later that day  Husband was about to throw the steaks on later that night for dinner and we had settled in to watch some good old ID Channel when I felt and heard a little pop. I knew my water had broke and told my husband and mom to go grab some towels. I waddled to the shower and just kind of stood in there letting whatever needed to come out. We called labor and delivery and they said come in and took about an hour until our ride got to the house. 

On the way there my contractions were starting, nothing too bad but they were ramping up. In triage they ran two tests to make sure my water had broke and asked a bunch of questions. We were at a teaching hospital and I almost yelled at a resident who was basically interrogating me with a pen and pad while I was having a contraction. Luckily the female attending doc stepped in for his safety. Did another COVID test and we waited for our labor and delivery room. Ob said I looked like 2 cm and they would be back in 6 hours to recheck. We ordered some pizza since this looked like it would be the last time I could eat for a bit. This was about 10 pm. Around 1 am I got my epidural. Not sure how dilated I was but the contractions were starting to get more intense. I had about 3/4 while getting it. It wasn't pleasant but omg are they magic. I was able to rest more and ""tried"" to sleep but I was too excited this was all happening. My husband did not have the same problem as me. There was a thunderstorm outside which is super rare for Socal and may have been the reason they labor and delivery ward was packed that night! 

By 8:45 the next morning I started feeling fluid gush down, nurse told me thats baby making his way down the birth canal. I'm at about 6 cm now and everyone is just making me feel like a rockstar with how thin and soft my cervix looks. Especially for being a first timer. My mom makes it to the hospital so I'm able to relax a bit more because I thought I'd go to 10 quick. I'm starving but it's all popsicle and jello for me. I start getting a little more uncomfortable and I can feel something changing, a couple hours later I'm at 10cm and we have the go ahead from the OB to start pushing with the nurse.

I begin pushing at 2:22. This number is engraved in my memory because I would be pushing for another 6 hours and just stared at this note on the wall. At first I made great progress. He was sliding down the birth canal perfectly and it looked like this would be a breeze. It was in fact, not a breeze. His head was right down there, my husband who did not know if he'd be a ""above the curtain"" or ""below the curtain"" was very much a below the curtain guy. I heard him get choked up when he saw the baby start parting my labia and thought this is it. It was in fact, not it. I began to feel so frustrated and was losing energy fast. In between contractions I legit fell asleep and could barely keep my eyes open. The OB came in and brought in an ultrasound to see what was up. Looks like baby was sunny side up and his face was having trouble making it under my pelvic bone. They rotated him, confirmed he was good to go and we push again. This OB then just left. By the shift change and at hour 6 I had enough. It felt so hopeless and I think it's the OB I had just sucked, there was no plan, no direction aside from just keep pushing with the nurse. I had a total breakdown and cried and cried. I could feel his head and I couldn't get him out no matter how long or hard I pushed. They kept upping my pitocin and the epidural wore out a little on the top of my belly. We tried to ""rest"" for a bit but the contractions were too uncomfortable. A new OB came on shift, came in with a game plan and we decided to go ahead with a forceps delivery. They took me and my husband to the operating room because he has better lighting. 

I was kind of nervous but I wanted this baby OUT. My epidural was adjusted, the nurse told them when I was having a contraction and I did three good pushes. The resident put in the forceps and with the next set of contractions I did 5 pushes. I felt him move out more and they lowered my butt to let gravity assist. After that last push he was slippery and screaming on my chest. Immediately did skin to skin as they cleaned him up. I delivered the placenta pretty quickly (couldn't feel it) and had a 2nd degree tear. Didn't feel the stitches, just some light tugging. It was so surreal. I had an actual human living inside me and now he was there screaming and wiggling on my chest. His Apgar scores came back at 8 and 9. He's a healthy 7lb 11.5 oz 19"" baby boy and came at 8:20 that night. 

The hospital and what happens next is another chapter (like when they just wheel you to postpartum and leave you with a baby we have no idea how to take care of) but we are home now.

I‚Äôm 6w4d. Last night I had some light pink spotting that had me worried but I assumed it was nothing since it‚Äôs common in early pregnancy.
This afternoon my husband and I were ending brunch and I went to the bathroom and saw bright red blood with some small clots on the toilet paper.

I asked if we should go to urgent care and he suggested straight to the ER since that‚Äôs likely where we‚Äôd end up anyway. 

At the ER they took a lot of blood samples and unfortunately at my first pregnancy appt there was no HCG level taken, just urine confirmation so there‚Äôs no baseline to compare HCG levels. But FWIW today‚Äôs are at 721.

They also did a transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound. The radiologist reviewed the images and said there was nothing they could see in my uterus.
Bottom line is it could be 3 things:
1. Miscarriage 
2. Ectopic pregnancy
3. Too soon to see anything in the ultrasound and time will tell

I have to schedule a follow up for blood work and another ultrasound in 2-3 days.

I‚Äôm 28th weeks pregnant, everything is going great so far and I occasionally had some bad thoughts like ‚Äúeverything is going super smooth, something bad will happen for sure‚Äù, but I always managed to make it go away. 

I also recently started purchasing and collecting stuff from friends and parents for my little girl, I wanted to wait until almost the third semester just in case but I felt it was time. 

Clue to my friend‚Äôs mom ruining my enthusiasm: I was telling her about something I bought and she goes ‚Äúit‚Äôs too soon‚Äù. 
And I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entering my eight month‚Äù and she reply ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too soon something bad can happen, you have to wait until the baby is born‚Äù and kept insisting. 

In the end it said to shush her ‚Äúif she‚Äôs going to die she will..‚Äù and I rushed out of the house. 

Now I‚Äôm torn between being super paranoid (especially at night) that my baby will die and I have all this stuff I already bought and be practical thinking ‚Äúhow can my husband buy EVERYTHING during my hospital stay? Or am I suppose to go shopping and furniture assembly with a week old baby? Was she for real? The chick is crazy‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm mostly practical, because something can happen all the time: now, during childbirth, the first year, when she‚Äôll get a car,‚Ä¶.. one cannot think ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt book my plane ticket until the day of the flight because I might die‚Äù but on the other end this episode made my ‚Äúbad thoughts‚Äù spike and I‚Äôm worried that being worried will eventually hurt the baby.

I received an ultrasound to check on baby, and her amniotic fluid looked good, but she measured small at roughly the 10.3 percentile. Since the margin of error varies from the 7th to 13the percentile (below 10th being of concern), the midwives recommended I get inducted at 39 weeks. 

This past Friday, at 39 weeks, we went into the hospital. I was 0.5 cm displayed upon arrival. 12 hrs of Cervidil had put me at 1 cm dilated &amp; 50% effaced. Followed by 3 doses of miso pills, with no further progress. Then, I decided on another 12 hr Cervidil insertion, but that also resulted in no further progress.    Needless to say, my cervix was not budging.

After 36 hours of monitoring, the midwives/doctor said the baby looked textbook healthy and beautiful on the monitor the whole time. With that, they sent us home. Baby will be monitored throughout this upcoming week. Given baby looks good, it sounds like we have may have the option to fall into labor naturally at home. 

It‚Äôs been a whirlwind to say the least, thinking our baby was at risk, going through all that with the hospital stay, and thinking we‚Äôd meet baby sooner than later.

I should also mention I‚Äôve had ADD my entire life and have been on medication since I was 14. That medication saved my life. Enabled me to go to an amazing university, get a job and become highly successful. My job transferred me to Australia 5 years ago to help grow their international business. From there I moved to an even better company and doubled my salary. My job is the thing I‚Äôve been most proud of in my life. And has yielded the most reward. I now have the ability to live in Australia for the rest of my life. I‚Äôve traveled more than anyone I know. I own a house. I met my husband. I support my parents. Without my career I would have none of this excitement and joy that life gave me.

But now that I‚Äôm pregnant I can‚Äôt take my medication anymore. Well, that‚Äôs not true. The truth is, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking the medication because there is very little research on the long term implications it would have on my child‚Äôs brain. But without this medication I legitimately can‚Äôt do my job. It doesn‚Äôt help that I don‚Äôt care AT ALL about the type of work I do, just the financial outputs and pride it gives me. I just can‚Äôt seem to care enough to even do the bare minimum. Being stuck in a 8 week lockdown in sydney hasn‚Äôt helped either. I feel tired, preoccupied, isolated.

Also found a small benign cyst on my left ovary..

They were unable to detect a heartbeat, but said it was too early to determine if that means miscarriage or not.

Towards the end i had them break my water and it went from 8 cm to ‚Äúokay we‚Äôre gunna deliver this baby now‚Äù it all happened so incredibly fast and he was out in maybe a few pushes i have no idea. He had pooped in utero so he had some issues with crying coming out. But he had a great apgar score. Afterwards i was bleeding quite a bit as i did with my first and they kept massaging and doing what they needed. (My birth team was incredible and honestly they could not have done better and i am so thankful for every single one of those people.) 
Anyway, we get to the postpartum room and everything is okay, i feed my baby, we hang out for a little bit and then we go to sleep.
In the night, i feel like, a huge cramp and then blood spills out, i call the nurse instead of getting up bc theres no way me or my husband can handle this but i had no idea how bad it was about to get. The nurse comes in and presses on my stomach and it was like a ketchup packet of clots, she said one was the size of a grapefruit. They call a code and get a cart and theres maybe 15 people all from my delivery in the room, trying to keep me calm and stop the bleeding, theres ivs being placed meds being stabbed into my leg. It was alot all at once but i knew if i freaked out itd get alot worse so i stayed calm. I lost about. 1200 ml so it called for two bags of blood and plasma which i have now completed. 
It could have been alot worse, but im so glad that i had the team that i did.

I really appreciated reading other‚Äôs birth stories when I was pregnant so I hope this one can help anyone else. I‚Äôm currently writing it while breastfeeding my baby boy, who in my humble opinion is the sweetest angel baby to ever grace this earth. What‚Äôs bias anyway?

So I had a pretty easy pregnancy, the only complication being a large fibroid, but that really just meant more frequent ultrasounds. I never experienced any Braxton Hicks, and after going past my due date I was pretty bummed and anxious to start labor (and SO done with being preggo). We went ahead and scheduled an induction for 40+5 but  had hopes that I wouldn‚Äôt need to be induced. But, after SO MANY walks and eating spicy foods, dates, and pineapple my induction date came with still no contractions. 

At around 9pm they administered cytotec. The doctor explained that typically FTMs need at least 2, if not more, doses to get things going and if needed they‚Äôll go from cytotec to pitocin. However she said that this whole process could take anywhere from 24-72 hours! So we were ready to buckle up and wait it out. The cytotec was 2 pills that the nurse inserted and placed next to my cervix. Placing them was uncomfortable because she really had to get up in there to get them in a good spot. But it only lasted about 30 seconds so it wasn‚Äôt too bad. She also checked my cervix and I was only about 1/2 cm dilated. The plan was to re-check my cervix at 4am and administer a second dose at that time, but in the meantime get some sleep. 

In order to absorb the cytotec effectively, I was on bed rest for the first 90 min. After that, I got up to use the bathroom and immediately had to vomit. The nurse said this was a good sign of labor beginning! I then tried to get some rest but began having mild contractions at fairly regular intervals. They started off feeling period crampy, but I also started having them in my low back. Eventually I could no longer comfortably lay in bed and needed to sit up/walk around. After being told this whole process would likely take &gt;24 hours my husband was pretty shocked and confused when I started needing more of his support to get through the contractions after only a couple hours!

At about midnight my nurse came in after having noticed my contractions increasing on the monitor. She gave me a yoga ball to sit on which helped immensely. As my contractions continued to intensify I started feeling them more in my hips and low back- this was surprising for me- I was expecting intense abdominal cramps with maybe some low back, but not the hip pain! 

I continued to have increasingly speedy contractions. I wasn‚Äôt timing them, but my husband said they were coming faster than every 5 minutes and lasting anywhere from 20-60 seconds. By 3am my nurse decided to check me early and I was at 3-4cm! The anesthesiologist was on the floor at the time and went ahead and administered the epidural. 

A note about epidurals- they are gods gift to earth. I have NO idea how I‚Äôd of made it through this process without one. Hats off to ladies who go without, you are superwomen. 

Getting the epidural was super easy, the hardest part was staying still while she placed it. It began to work within 5 min, but took closer to 20 to have complete effects. Once I received the epidural I was so much more comfortable. I continued to have regular contractions with no pain, and was actually able to move my legs a little bit. However because I continued to progress so quickly, my baby‚Äôs heart rate started consistently dipping low after each contraction. The nurse checked with the doctor, and eventually they gave me a shot of a medicine meant to slow down the contractions. This seemed to help, but I continued to progress steadily. 

By 6am I was at 8cm! At this time the nurse was closely watching baby‚Äôs HR and helping me move/get into positions that helped keep it high enough. My membranes had still not ruptured, so the doctor ruptured them around 6:30am and almost immediately, baby‚Äôs HR regulated. We continued to monitor my contractions and rest while waiting to be fully dilated. The nurses had a shift change at 7:30, and around this time they checked me and had me do a few practice pushes, then pretty quickly got me started doing real pushing. With the epidural I couldn‚Äôt feel contractions to know when to push, however I definitely started to feel increasingly intense pressure on my vagina/butt. With some good coaching from the OB I was able to learn how to push better and ended up pushing for a little over 2 hours before little man was born! Tbh those 2 hours are kind of a blur. I found I was most comfortable when I would shut my eyes during each push, so I really didn‚Äôt see much lol instead I just listened to my husband‚Äôs coaching and let it happen. 

Another surprise to me was how intensely I felt the pressure to push! I knew I‚Äôd still feel it with the epidural, but damn. The whole time I was laboring I was convinced I was tearing my butthole open- I didn‚Äôt want to ask what the damage was looking like because I didn‚Äôt want to know the answer. Actually delivering the baby and placenta felt so good because the pressure was finally gone! We had kept gender a surprise so my husband was able to tell me it was a boy, and he got to cut the cord. They placed the baby on my chest and I immediately burst into tears. I had some mild tearing on my labia, which the doctor stitched up right there.

Overall it was a relief that I wasn‚Äôt waiting for labor to start for very long, and in retrospect I wonder if my body was ready to go into labor on its own soon anyway. Baby is healthy and about 10 days out I‚Äôm feeling more like myself!

Now that we‚Äôve been home a few days I have a few postpartum tips/tricks I wanted to share:

1. Bring your boppy to the hospital and use it as a donut pillow. I originally brought my boppy to help with breastfeeding but instead just used a ton of hospital pillows to prop him up while I sat on the boppy. I‚Äôve continued to use it more often as a seat for me than breastfeeding support while I heal.

2. Have hemorrhoid ointment ready. 

3. Download the huckleberry app! It‚Äôs been awesome for tracking diapers, feedings, and sleep. 

4. Pack compression socks for the hospital. I was given lots of IV fluids during labor and ended up super puffy, especially in my feet and ankles. Wearing compression socks has made that more comfortable and helped the swelling go down.",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,92842,public,self,"Graduated!

I had a cousin berate me for putting my child through trauma due to circumstances I have no control over such as the child‚Äôs fathers anger outbursts, even though that wouldn‚Äôt be me, that would be him as nobody asks for the treatment he had previously given me. She‚Äôs not saying it cos she cares, she‚Äôs saying it bc she‚Äôs a social worker and believes she‚Äôs got the knowledge to. I‚Äôve been in contact with a social worker who told me the same thing, but nicer and the impact was the same but i felt less hurt and blamed for things I cannot control?? So I don‚Äôt really believe in ‚Äòharsh love‚Äô or any of that, people need to learn to read the room. I feel she always has a tendency to look down on me and I always have to remind her our experiences of life are not and haven‚Äôt ever been the same 

And then today had my dad (no offence what would he know, he‚Äôs a man with the only medical knowledge being what he‚Äôs read and experienced) tell me water birth is basically stupid, and just overall laugh at me and call me dumb for it and say he‚Äôs had more experience than me because he‚Äôs watched children being born. The last one him seeing being born, which is me, in 1999, over 20 years ago ü§®. He said he gives me his ‚Äòapproval‚Äô as if I needed him to tell me how a child I made is coming out of ME lol. 

Me and my mother don‚Äôt get along due to her excessive drinking, which is also what helped spark a case up against me (therapist broke my confidentiality lol). She can be a nice person, but she‚Äôs said a lot of things she can‚Äôt come back from as well. 

I‚Äôm feeling more and more isolated and it‚Äôs making me so depressed and tbh suicidal, I‚Äôm not really seeing any light at the end of the tunnel. Yes I‚Äôve told midwives (got referred to a perinatal team but waiting for that call) and my therapist, but ever since she broke my confidentiality I just don‚Äôt trust them anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm being judged and watched - especially since the social worker asked to be able to contact my midwives about my pregnancy literally about 2 days after I decided to be as honest as I could be about how I felt. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I know why my therapist did it to an extent but now I feel like I‚Äôve exhausted all my options. I also feel bad because the emotions I‚Äôm feeling are a heavy set of emotions for a baby to be feeling but I legit haven‚Äôt been happy once the whole time I‚Äôve been pregnant. I know they say pregnancy is hard and raising a child is hard, but surely it is not meant to feel this hard.

Im 16 weeks pregnant, a minor asthmatic and feeling worried about getting the vaccine, I've spoken to my doctor and he said it should be safe to get the vaccine now that im in my 2nd trimester and asked me to assess if im in a high risk area in my day to day life. Has there been enough research and results with Pfizer to ensure its completely safe for pregnant women? 

I was speaking to a friend the other day and her son's friend was 7 months pregnant and had a miscarriage after getting the vaccine. I'm not sure if it's directly related to the vaccine or not but my friend believes it is. And says I shouldn't get it. She is not getting the vaccine and her Doctor friend isn't getting it either. 

I live in regional South Auatralia so we have never been exposed to covid in our community (so far), I guess in that respect, I dont live in a high risk area like a city. My husband has said he supports me either way, he and the rest of my family who live with me are getting vaccinated in the next couple of weeks.

We just moved to a new area and just don‚Äôt know anyone around to really lean on. We do have some family around but struggling to find help with childcare during the week, specifically Wednesdays through Fridays from 7am-6pm.. 

I‚Äôm 26 weeks pregnant and basically found out my body is preparing for labor at our last ultrasound and I‚Äôm at high risk for going into preterm labor.. So I‚Äôm writing this while in the hospital on hospital bedrest.. and it looks like it‚Äôs going to be an unexpected long stay here if the baby isn‚Äôt born this premature.. .. I know I‚Äôm here at least another two weeks if not more (unless the baby comes early)

 we need to figure out childcare. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom so that was my thing and now that I‚Äôm here at the hospital we are struggling with what to do with our 3 year old boy and 1 year old girl. My mom currently has been watching them during the week when my husband is working but she lives in another state and has already been here for two weeks and really does need to get back to her job. Everyone that wants to help has a job themselves, so finding help during the week temporarily until either I am allowed to go back home or until the baby comes is hard. 

What would you do in my situation? We only need Wednesday‚Äôs through Friday for potentially 3/4 weeks‚Ä¶ days are from 7am-6pm.. so daycare isn‚Äôt really an option because of the unknown situation we are in, who knows when this baby girl will come.. I‚Äôm praying it‚Äôs not until a few weeks so she has a better chance!! 

My husband does work from home but can‚Äôt really work and watch the kids at the same time and we need his income as it‚Äôs our only income.

Doctor told me last week that he thinks I'm around eight weeks - I'm unsure as I came off the pill in May, had spotting for over a month, a normal period early to mid June, and went back to spotting for over a month, then nothing.

I don't know how worried I should be about MC. I'm concerned as I only have a few of the symptoms I hear so much about - cramping (no bleeding), incredibly sore boobs, bloated, and emotional. I haven't been vomiting, I've no food aversion or specific craving. I find myself taking a test every other day to make sure it's still positive. I'm taking pregnancy vitamins and I'm trying to eat better (but honestly doing a lousy job at it. My fiance and I love takeaway food).

My first antenatal appointment is week after next, where they take urine and bloods, and my first scan is early September.

We weren't trying for long, we thought it might take a long time, and for that I am greatful. But I keep thinking one day I'll wake up and think huh, had the most realistic dream I was pregnant. Every time I pee I inspect the tissue for blood. I'm scared to have sex, in case it hurts or we're too rough that we cause some sort of damage. The other day my bus went over a bump and I was jolted into my seat and i worried it might have 'popped' the baby!!

I know if the worst happens, it happens, and often it does and there's nothing we could've done. I'm trying to enjoy my news every day, but every day is shadowed with 'it might not last'.

Aside from sorting out my crappy eating habits, taking vitamins and going for walks, is there anything in particular I can do that will lower chances of MC?

Hi all,

I'm 6 weeks pregnant today. I've been very nauseous and fatigued this last week. I am also incredibly anxious because every day I am spotting. My doctor has me coming in for lab work tomorrow to test HCG and progesterone levels and again on Thursday for similar tests. 

The spotting is brown, rust colored almost. It's only when I wipe, usually a couple times in the morning and again at night. It has been almost every day and it really is freaking me out. I've had mild inconsistent cramping, very mild. 

I had a CP my last pregnancy at 5 weeks and I can't help but worry this is another. It does feel different this time than last time, but the spotting has me worried. I can't feel excited at all to be pregnant, just scared.

We were married in October 2020 after downsizing from 115 people indoors to 30 people in a park. Our wedding was beautiful and I am happy with how it turned out and we were fortunate that no one became sick after the event. However, we could not cancel our original venue but instead moved our reservation and most vendors to the same day in 2021. 

Originally, we had planned on doing a vow renewal but ended up pregnant in November 2020. We decided to change our event to a Halloween Anniversary party. I am 37 weeks now and we are both vaccinated. However, with this Delta variant, I am hesitant to be in a large group with a baby that will only be 7 weeks old. I plan on having her in a wrap on me the whole time so that no one will be tempted to stick their face too close to hers. The majority of my family and my inlaws are vaccinated, save for my mom who is working with her doctor to adjust meds before she gets the shot. All of my friends are vaccinated, but a handful of my husband's friends are not. Most of those friends will be travelling from out of state if they come at all. 

We cant cancel and refund because we already pushed our date back with all of our vendors once. We're talking $20k in losses at this point. We had a long engagement and had a lot paid for before the pandemic blew up. In hindsight we should have cut our losses last year. I'm not sure how to move forward. Should I make vaccinations ""required?"" Uninvite those unvaccinated? Downsize again? I'm open to any advice at this point.

I recently moved into my second trimester (woohoo!) and my family has been pestering me about my birth plan. As obsessed I am with my pregnancy, it still doesn‚Äôt feel real to me, so of course I haven‚Äôt been planning anything. My father came to visit me (rather rudely, just booked a ticket and said he was showing up) and I politely told him to never do that again, to call before he booked his ticket, to see if it was alright. He laughed it off and said he wouldn‚Äôt be coming until I dropped the baby. 

First of all, it‚Äôs not a mixtape. I stated very bluntly: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt anyone to visit me after I give birth. I have two months to spend bonding this child, my husband and I will take that time to get to know the new addition to the family.‚Äù He of course was appalled, offended even. But he quickly covered it up with ‚Äúwhatever, that‚Äôs your life.‚Äù 

My mother starts hinting at who‚Äôs going to babysit my child (I don‚Äôt have the best relationship with her, so I take a lot of what she says with a grain of salt). I tell her I‚Äôll hire a licensed babysitter until I can get a shift transfer to a part time job. ‚ÄúSave some money, I‚Äôll fly out to you when you give birth and you can go back to work early.‚Äù

I started working at a sign production shop last year, and when I let my main supervisor know I was pregnant back in April, she seemed to be very understanding.
My job is very tedious and labor intensive, since I'm having to pick up large vinyl rolls heavier than 50 pounds, and constantly on my feet for the majority of my 9 hour shift, so we discussed bringing in a shop assistant to help me once I was further along. We also discussed moving me into working on design and customer service as to not have me on the production floor and allow me time to rest up until baby was born. 
My boss unfortunately has backpedaled on everything we discussed, and she found me a shop assistant, but she let me know she doesn't 'have room for me' at the shop, primarily due to a failed inspection at a new office they are trying to move into. They were expecting to be moved into a new location by the end of September, but something went wrong and they're expecting to wait to move at least 4 more months. 
She let me know that she simply doesn't know where to put me in the office, and wants me to train the new guy for a month before ultimately deciding to either work for them part time or to go on unemployment. 
I'm honestly very stressed out; my boyfriend and I were working on a down payment for a house but this is possibly going to set us back a lot financially. I am mostly upset because in the small shop of 6 people, I am the only one that has the most physically labor intensive position, with everyone else sitting at their desk for their shifts and not doing anything strenuous during their day to day schedule, and there is always plenty of work to be done.

I was already nervous since my last csection gave me a hemmorage and a pulmonary embolism but I was trying to stay positive since my ob was actually in town this time. 

Me and my husband go in, they start the process and not even 5mnts later I hear the baby crying, it wad a good 30 seconds before everything went south. My ob sounded super concerned and asked if I was planning to have more kids. We said yes but she said I was loosing too much blood too fast due to having placenta previa (?) Or something like that so at the end she would have to perform a hysterectomy.  I was in shock and clearly could feel like loss of blood because I started feeling drowsy and nauseous. My husband almost passed out so they had to scort him out of the room. My ob was yelling at everyone and calling for backup.  At this point the only thing going to my head was ""please, please I just wanna see my toddler waiting for me at home and my new baby "". Anyways she managed to get everything under control and managed to leave an ovary and tube behind and cervix so at least there's that but my uterus is gone.

I can't sleep. Some of this is due to pregnancy stage (just entering 3rd trimester &amp; up at night to pee), but I'm also currently at my parents cottage for the weekend and there are people having a party across the lake which has woken up my 6 month old puppy.

I'm hoping a brain dump will help me. I've been up for almost 2 hours and can't seem to fall asleep. I've tried listening to a meditation, cuddling the dog, changing sleeping positions but no luck.

I'm overwhelmed. 12 weeks until my due date and work is busier than ever. I feel like I am not doing anything well anymore. I have a new team member starting on Monday and haven't had the time to plan his week so he can effectively relieve some of our team... I'm behind on responding to email, have been covering for other staff while on vacation and am in a senior role such that there is no obvious successor to my role. I told a client about my upcoming leave (and laid out a plan for thier coverage) and the first thing they said was ""I guess that's the risk in hiring young women""... Wtf

Our puppy will be 9 months old when the baby arrives. I've started him going for walks with a dog walker once a week to get him used to other people, he's signed up for puppy classes but they're the last 6 weeks before our due date. I'm hoping to split class attendance with my husband but he will be challenged to get there on time from his work. We're trying to get the puppy neutered before baby as well because I don't want to have a recovering pup and a newborn at the same time but the vet is unsure if we can do it yet... Obviously we will do what is best for the dog but it's just another thing. I love our pup so much, but it's feeling more and more difficult to give him the energy and attention he needs right now and I feel like I'm failing. My husband is a great help but I work at home and feel like naturally more is left to me because I'm home all day. 

My sister in law is arriving in a week to stay with us for a month. She is wonderful but tends to bring some chaos. I need to let go of my natural instinct to entertain while she's here, especially because I will be in the house working. I wish I didn't feel stressed out about her visit but I do. Of the 4 weeks she's here, my husband and I are only able to take one of the weeks off work. 
By the time she leaves it will be 6 weeks until due date. 

There isn't time for me to have a baby shower and although I don't think I can handle planning another thing, part of me is sad because this is our first baby. My mom suggested holding one after the baby is born but I'm not sure if I'll want to - has anyone done this and was it worthwhile? 

I'm just feeling tired and that I'm letting myself down. I'm someone who usually manages to do it all and I'm not afraid to ask for help, just feeling shitty at the moment.

I got my first positive Frer last Saturday August 7th when I was cd29. My tests looked great. My progesterone level was 98! 

Went to get my beta on Monday: first was 232.

Wednesday I started getting spotting and went for a beta which was 358.

Friday I went for another beta which was 279 :( still had spotting - no blood flow. 

Saturday (today) spotting cleared, will go for another beta on Monday but I guess this pregnancy doesn‚Äôt seem to be looking good. 

I did take letrozole 7.5 mg this cycle and I don‚Äôt know how many mature follicles I had- the last time when I was on 5 mg I had 2. But we upped the dose this month with no ultrasound monitoring. 

I‚Äôve read that ectopic pregnancies usually have betas that go up and down, but their progesterone usually stays low - under 20.

Baby girl was due on the 26th so she's 12 days early, and tiny! Weighs 6lb 11oz and is perfect.

It's kind of a crazy story! My hubby and I were chatting about politics super late at night (about 12:20) when all of a sudden I felt and HEARD a snapping in my pelvis that led to cramps, so I went to the bathroom. After a few trips there, my water broke in a fairly dramatic way, but luckily I managed to get most of the fluid into the toilet! Called midwife and she said if contractions don't start in 12 hours, call for an appointment and come in to get induced.

Well, while I was on the phone I had my first contraction, and it was much stronger than I had been expecting! Way worse than period cramps. Drew myself a bath and they got milder, but I basically had one ten mins apart, then 8 mins, then a couple at 5, a few at 4, and by the time I got out of the bath (around 1:30), they were three mins apart. Time to go! But it was too fast and we weren't prepared for our dog people to come (we thought we would last until morning!) so we packed everything up, including the dog with severe separation anxiety, and headed to hospital. 

By the time we were at hospital my contractions were every minute and very intense. Got checked in to triage and at that point was still having tiny breaks. I was 7cm dilated already. This was about 2:55am. Husband left to go take dog to my sister. We figured we had at least an hour before baby's arrival. I was going to get an epidural. NOPE.

Basically as soon as he left, contractions became nonstop. I was in so much pain I couldn't focus on anything except that, then I felt like I had to take the biggest poop of my life (which I know means it's time to push). This was only ten mins after my cervical check. I went from 7cm to fully dilated in 10 mins. No wonder the contractions were so intense! I probably woke the entire hospital up with my yelling.

So they started wheeling me to my labor room and I couldn't NOT push, the urge was so strong. Midwife encouraged me telling me I was doing the exact right thing, I was doing great. Got to room, got transferred to new bed (hardest task yet), pushed a few times on my side because I couldn't get up. They couldn't find heartbeat because baby was so low so they wanted to hook her up to head monitor and had me switch to hands and knees, but at that point I pushed twice more and out she came! She was born at 3:20am, only 25 mins after arriving at the hospital. 2nd degree tear, unmedicated on accident (trust me, I wanted that epidural so bad), and hubby totally absent üòÇ. I told him he didn't miss much except me literally screaming into a pillow. Baby girl was just ready for this world!

Anyway, short labor but long story. I'm also operating on 37 hours without sleep so far so sorry if it's a bit of a ramble. Thanks for reading!

Waited a while took a shower  made sure I had everything in my hospital bag and then headed off to the hospital. By 4 30 contractions started getting alot stronger. Arrived at the hospital at 4.45. Was kept because of my contractions being so close. Went in with the mindset of not having an epidural but also had an open mind that anything can happen. To accept as it comes. Hours went by and my body couldn't handle the pain...my body wouldn't dilate past 6cm on it own . 6 hours went by without dilating past 6 cm. Nurse said probably because I was in too much pain for my body to keep dilating on its own. Made the decision of an epidural after all. Glad I did. As soon as I received it my body took its course and after 6 hours of being stuck at only 6 cm. Finally, my body an hour later with the help of epidural went from 6 to 9 and a half cm dilated. Another half hour and I was ready to push. The pushing for myself was the best part. Knowing my lil man and I were so close to meeting. I pushed for an hour and my boy was born. He's on the bigger side  Weighing 8lb 9 Oz. Overall just keep a positive mind. Breath and keep in mind anything can happen!

I am in my 12th week. My nausea has improved so much!!! It‚Äôs odd though, my nausea isn‚Äôt as debilitating, but I have been closer to actually throwing up. It takes a lot to get me to actually vomit, but this past week, the wrong smell has me about to spew all over the place. My sense of smell is much stronger! One day, I could smell toilet water as soon as I entered a public bathroom. I had to hold my breath the entire time I was in the bathroom. That was the one that actually made me puke a little. Even the thought of something disgusting gives me a weak stomach at times, Which is strange because I‚Äôm not a squeamish person at all! 

I finally stopped bleeding! Now I only spot when I have sex. My appetite has gotten more under control. I was eating in excess to avoid the nausea, but now that the nausea isn‚Äôt so bad, I can eat when I‚Äôm hungry and not all day long. Anyone going through severe nausea, sucking on candy helped me. Towards the last couple weeks of my worst, I was able to control my eating with sucking on hard candy. 

I‚Äôm no where near as exhausted. I‚Äôm able to work closer to my normal pace again! I‚Äôm still sleeping a ton though. 

Emotionally, it cry a lot easier at silly things. Commercials, movies, songs, anything that pulls the strings a little has me tearing up. 

Aversions: coffee, fish, anything that hits my sense of smell the wrong way. I‚Äôve been able to stop eating if I‚Äôm not really feeling the food, which is odd for me because I don‚Äôt like to waste food. 

cravings: I haven‚Äôt had too many cravings, it‚Äôs been more about eating what I can stomach. I did crave a few things I don‚Äôt typically eat. Ranch wings, fruity pebble‚Äôs, fruit gummy snacks.

Went in for induction at 6 pm on July 28. I was 2 cm dilated and \~50% effaced. The midwife/OB team laid out options for induction - I opted to start with cervical balloon and misoprostol. They said cervical balloon would hurt, and might take 12 hours to fall out (it falls out when you are 4 cm dilated). They suggested putting off epidural for as long as possible. Also suggested that eventually I'd probably need pitocin. Ballon went in at 8 pm, very intense contractions began shortly after. Nurse came and pulled slightly on balloon around 11 pm and it fell out. Pain subsided for a bit and I got into the bathtub. By around 1 am I laid down next to my husband and felt a pop, which was my water breaking. Got up and stood in a pool of amniotic fluid that came rushing out. After this the contractions became extremely intense. It was clear at this point that I would not need pitocin to get labor going. I asked for epidural around 2 am. By far the most painful and intense contractions occurred while epidural was being put in (I realized I waited slightly too long to ask for it). I was shaking uncontrollably while the anesthesiologist  and many nurses stood around trying to insert the thing. By the time they checked me after the epidural was in I was 8 cm dilated. Once the epidural kicked in (took at least 30 min), things felt great. I rested a bit, and by around 6 am I started pushing. Pushing extremely physically draining, but not at all painful. He was sunny-side up, so OB suggested manually rotating him as he descended - which worked (I imagine this would have been enormously painful without an epidural).

My SIL has friends visiting and they‚Äôre staying at this hotel that‚Äôs literally a 5 minute walk from my house. We aren‚Äôt very close but we were invited as a sort of second bachelorette thing but with the husbands and the couples 2 year old,  because the lady of the couple friends and I couldn‚Äôt make it to the other one she held. 

We went over there last night had some pizza, the not pregnant ppl had drinks, and I did leave a little early but it was fine. They were planning on going to the Pool after dinner and I pulled SIL aside and told her that I really don‚Äôt feel comfortable in a bathing suit right now so I wouldn‚Äôt be joining them. Her response was oh do you want me to take you shopping for one? That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm uncomfortable. She‚Äôs already made comments about my pregnant body that made me feel super uncomfortable in the past but I think my husband talked to her about it because she hasn‚Äôt said anything since. 

Anyways today they wanted us to join them from 10am-4pm‚Ä¶first of all 6 hours is a long ass time, but anyways I went over and hung out and then they all walked over to the water park with a lazy river etc. The plan was for them to go in the lazy river and have beers etc. I didn‚Äôt bring my bathing suit, I just feel such extreme anxiety about people seeing my body right now. My husband asks what I‚Äôm going to do while they do the lazy river and I tell him I‚Äôll probably just head back to our place because otherwise I‚Äôd just be sitting there hot and alone.

On top of that my SIL and her family (2 girls, one who can be vaccinated but isn't, and one who can't but has asthma) went to FLORIDA! They are in crowded places posting pics with no masks, my husband said they can't come around for 2 weeks after they return, which is the day before I'm set to be induced.

I am just so shocked, they were all serious about this, but now that it has ""gone on too long"" they don't care, and they don't understand we have 2 very small humans who are vulnerable.

I can't have my own family here because they live in Australia, and we live in the biggest Hotspot of Washington, so my stress levels are through the roof.

I am 37 weeks along (FTM), and baby boy dropped starting on Wednesday (three days ago). I had a strangely soft bowel movement, and after that I noticed some discomfort on my butthole. I didn‚Äôt pay it too much attention until Thursday, when discomfort became pain, and then the pain became pretty extreme. Literally every movement I made hurt my butt - I didn‚Äôt even know we used those muscles to reach our arms out or move our feet! I was miserable and at my wits end, and I talked to my OB about it. 

It turns out I have a thrombosed hemorrhoid, which is like a hemorrhoid on steroids. This thing was the size of a grape and the color of eggplant. If I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, an ER doctor could have done something to relieve it, but my OB told me that no one would treat it at 37 weeks. That saved me a trip to the ER at least‚Ä¶ We decided on a game plan for pain management, because I had been trying all the traditional hemorrhoid treatments with absolutely no relief (epsom salt bath, Tucks pads, Preparation H). She offered to write a prescription for a narcotic, but I haven‚Äôt done so well with those in the past and decided to pass this time. 

The thing that has been the most helpful for me is taking an incontinence underwear and putting water in the back half of it and then freezing it. That makes a nice ice pack that I don‚Äôt have to worry about leaking. I‚Äôve kept doing all the other treatments and have been keeping the area clean, but those still have no short term relief. 

I‚Äôm two days past from the worst of this hemorrhoid, and I am feeling so much better. The hemorrhoid has shrunk and I‚Äôm able to move around almost normally. I lay down for naps at least twice a day now, and I think that helps to take pressure off my pelvis. 

Ladies and gents, if you end up dealing with this too, good luck. It absolutely sucks, and I know some people have it worse than me.

I had a wonderful anatomy scan ultrasound and baby girl looks fantastic. I have an 18 month old boy at home. I did not ever show any signs or symptoms of preeclampsia during my pregnancy with him and he was born large and healthy. I have felt different this entire pregnancy. I am told repeatedly that all pregnancies are different, or that being pregnant with a girl is somehow worse.  However, I have noticed a few things that have me in my head and anxious. I am curious if you think these may be preludes to preeclampsia!

1. My blood pressure has been elevated. Prior to pregnancy, and really my whole life my blood pressure has been between 100/70 - 110/80. At my last check up my blood pressure was 127/80. And I just took it again on my home cuff and it was 120/71. I was told this is within the normal range, but this has never been normal for me. I understand that these measurements are no cause for immediate concern. But it makes me think I should at least be monitored more closely for preeclampsia as my pregnancy progresses. When I seemed surprised, the nurse brushed off my reaction.

2. I have been having migraines. I've only had three migraines thus far in the pregnancy, but if you have ever had one...you know it's not a headache. It's a different animal. Sensitivity to light and sound. Relentlessly lasting all day. Pain instead of ache. I haven't had a migraine since high school, and the was determined to be due to the birth control I was on. They stopped once I went off my birth control, and have never ressumed until now, at 31. My doctor said this is just hormonal headaches. I never had one during my last pregnancy.

3. I have already gained 20 lbs. I just cannot rectify this level of weight gain half way through my pregnancy with my healthy diet and activity level. If anything I have to remind myself to eat and rest. Remember, 18 month old boy at home. I just can't reconcile how 20 lbs packed on so quickly. And it has ecelerated to that amount very quickly. I had gained 10 lbs at 18 weeks. Then the next 10 happened somewhat rapidly. My doctor clearly thinks I'm just lying about my healthy diet. 

4. My right side, from hip to rib is very sensitive. I cannot rest or sleep on this side. And sometimes I feel a shooting pain, though this is has happened only a handful of times.

They know i don't speak to their daughter, they wish it were different, and they spend a lot of time with her, so they were rightfullt concerned to have to keep this secret from her.

10 days ago I began experiencing symptoms  - specifically boob pain that I never get - and knew I needed to test. Strong positive about 5 days before my missed period.

I continued to have boob pain and typical cramping for a week. Both symptoms were fairly strong and consistent‚Ä¶.. and frankly, so exciting to me. 

Yesterday the boob pain + cramps subsided quite a bit. This morning I‚Äôve had little pain as well. I still had a strong positive today, at 23 DPO (it is time for me to stop testing before hook effect)..   But I‚Äôm just terribly nervous. I‚Äôve had little nausea, now the symptoms I had been feeling aren‚Äôt as strong.

Is it normal for symptoms to fluctuate? Is it normal to have a day or a couple days where‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt feel much going on?

In Florida. Where shit is hitting the fan. At first, I was thinking ""why get it now when it's full efficacy wouldn't hit until maternity leave, anyways?"" but then the thought of having to quarantine from my baby in the first few weeks of her life hit me and I just can't fathom that.

So. I have been doing a lot of research. I know there is a stigma surrounding unvaccinated people, painting them as selfish for not doing their part to end the pandemic. I struggled for a while with the thought of anything entering my body in which we don't know the long-term side effects. It's the same way I feel about eating GMO foods or vaping: we just *don't know* because those things haven't been around long enough to have enough data. But I read a few very informative articles about the history of vaccines, and how all ""long-term side effects"" have pretty much, without fail, revealed themselves in the first 8-12 weeks after injection. So, basically: hidden, scary, unpredictable side effects that could occur ten years down the line simply don't exist in the world of vaccines. This was very comforting to me, but it got me thinking...

The rhetoric of many vaccinated people seems to be ""trust in science"" or ""it takes two seconds of Googling to assuage any fears"" etc. Maybe it's because I've always been one of those ""but why?"" people, but like... *Why* were you all so willing to trust in science? What did you find in your research that made you so convinced the vaccine wasn't even a little scary? How is it that ""two seconds"" of Googling was all you needed when I've literally Googled for hours and still have questions? Most importantly: Didn't the thought of ""we could be being lied to, regardless of how credible the source is"" cross your mind? 

To clarify, I absolutely *do* believe in science and absolutely *do not* think that there is a microchip or anything in the vaccine (lolol), but I guess I'm just wondering how so many people out there are so much *more* trusting than I am. I'm naturally very skeptical and I was raised by a crazy anti-vaxxer mom (whose bullshit I never fully bought into), so there's that, but I guess I'm just wondering, aren't more of you concerned with the what-if? Or did every single one of you who are vaccinated do hours of research beforehand?

I have 2 jobs; one is full-time as an ER nurse and the other is a part-time, contracted research position with a chemotherapy drug development company.

I'm happy that he's still attracted to me and shows interest, but like, damn... sometimes I really do just want him to rub my back.

The only time he puts any real effort into touching me is when he wants some, but every time I straight up ASK him for a back rub, he either acts annoyed and inconvenienced, OR he distractedly uses one hand (the other one is swiping on his phone, and just....sweeps the back of his hand across the same 2 inches over and over again. Like he's not even aware of touching me. I asked for one last night and that's what I got. After a couple minutes I was like...okay....if I don't specify my needs, how can he know what to do? So I just came out and asked him if he could, quote, ""switch up the motion a little"". You know, stop petting the same spot?? Actually TOUCH me? And his response was to let out a huge, exasperated sigh, put his phone down, and remind me of the time, like it's too late to touch me or something. Then he starts to rub my back. Like, no. Why would I want you to touch me now after you've let me know how I am inconveniencing you? I just told him never mind, to which he responded that I was over-reacting and he was just changing positions to rub my back better. I'm like... no? You literally just basically told me how I am inconveniencing you, so no. Never mind. We went to bed that way without resolving anything. 

What really gets to me is that I frequently (daily) offer to rub his head, run my fingers through his hair, a c t u a l l y massage his back when he says something hurts or asks me to. He'll just lay his head in my lap and it's automatic. But for him to put any true effort into touching me, there's got to be the promise of an orgasm. 

I JUST WANT TO BE TOUCHED WITH INTENTION, NOT AN AGENDA. I WANT RECIPROCATION. I want him to WANT to rub my back, because he wants to make me feel good, not because he wants to rub his d*** against me.

I also have a history of bad depression and still suffer from extreme anxiety from time to time. Also have some chemical imbalances which is most likely the causes of my depression and anxiety. And despite having a painkiller dependancy I actually don't like doctors and prescription drugs. I would rather go the holistic route if needed.

I'm 15w4d, I grew up in a cold country, and I'm currently living in a warmer European country that is going through a heatwave.

- Our apartment doesn't have AC, so we are using fans instead.
- We close the blinds and windows during the day, and open everything at night.
- I drink as much cold water as I can, and eat cold fruit and salads. 
- I regularly go take cool showers throughout the day and don't dry myself afterwards.
- I regularly use a water spray on my face and body.

... but my body just *cannot* cool down, no matter what I do. Last night I must have slept 3 hours total. Today I feel horrible, all I feel capable of doing is lying on my bed with two fans on me. And I am still not cooling down. Plus the heat makes my nausea even worse. I am just extremely uncomfortable.

Is anyone here used to very hot climate/heatwaves, and has other tricks to cool down?? Bonus: any tricks to make my pets more comfortable as well?

I was supposed to have my second vaccine today, which I would be allowed out of lockdown for. But. Yesterday I got a sore throat. By last night, it was awful and I had a fever too and barely slept. Keeping in mind that I‚Äôm not getting comfortable to sleep at the moment anyway at 22 weeks. My doctor‚Äôs app wouldn‚Äôt let me book a testing appointment without canceling my vaccination, and their phone line is insane these days.

So I went to the clinic and asked at the testing part of the clinic, to be told ‚Äúno, you can‚Äôt have the vaccination while sick, you‚Äôll need to rebook. Also, all our testing appointments are full, so you‚Äôll need to go elsewhere‚Äú. Now, elsewhere is the drive through testing sites where people have been waiting for over eight hours and still getting turned away, due to this sudden outbreak. They also can‚Äôt prescribe antibiotics if this is not Covid nor write medical certificates. I almost broke down. I begged very pathetically that I was feeling appalling, had barely slept, was worried about not getting tested ASAP because of my baby, and won‚Äôt be able to wait in my car for eight hours without having to pee eight times (with nowhere to do that). Could they please please fit me in? The nurse chuckled and said ‚Äúoh okay, come on in‚Äù. So glad! First amazing person.

The doctor was great, very quick, answered all my questions, gave me antibiotics, a Covid test and a medical certificate. Second amazing person.

How do I get the antibiotics if I am now in isolation? I called my local pharmacy and asked if they would accept a photo of the script if my brother in law was to pick it up. They said yes, and they would chat to him about which medication I could take to feel better too (The answer is, not much, but at least they tried to help). Third amazing person.

My brother in law went straight out, bought my antibiotics, asked about all other medication that I could have and bought me anything they recommended in case I didn‚Äôt have it at home, picked up bread, milk and icy poles for my sore throat, and then popped it all in the boot of my car for a quick contactless delivery. Fourth amazing, awesome person!

I am home now, still feeling awful but at least medicated and tested, and feeling very lucky that so many people had compassion today.

She frequently texts my husband though and always asks about him and his life or just sends things to get his attention like stuff from when he was a kid, etc. 

When we announced our pregnancy she didn't even say congratulations. At 20 weeks in a fb message she told me she wanted to wait until it was official in case I had a miscarriage.

The day of my shower around 30 weeks she texted and said she forgot she planned a trip for that day and then never showed up (my husband couldn't go to the shower due to the military so I had a feeling she wouldn't come. She has said some insensitive things to my hubby about my mom and I figured she didn't want to be in a place where most of my family was). 

She seems to love her son but when it comes to me I feel like there's just not a relationship there at all. 

She isn't a terrible person but she is so scatterbrained and only seems to think about herself.

I just wonder what it'll be like when my son is born since he is a product of him and I. Will I be ignored as I am now? I can tolerate her and be around her and try to make an effort but I stay my distance because she does the same. When I do text her she always says she'll get back to me but never does. She also loves posting about our baby on Facebook but at the same time never asks me about the pregnancy so I feel very annoyed by that.

Hey all, I had a few people ask for an update post-op. I had my surgery today and it seems to have gone well :) Mass removed, ovary removed, and fallopian tube removed from the left side. 


Right now I hurt pretty much everywhere from the pelvis up. The surgery was done laparoscopically and I have 4 small inch-long incisions on my belly now. Baby is doing good, heart rate in the 150s pre and post-op. Moving is hard but my husband is amazing and the least painful way for me to get up has been to throw a beach towel behind my shoulders and have him pull me up so I don‚Äôt have to use barely any abdominal muscles. 


I have a fairly high pain tolerance but when I first woke up I will say my pain was about a 7/10 and I was super nauseous. Oddly enough they had me smell a rubbing alcohol wipe to relieve the nausea and it worked (who knew!) and for the pain they gave me dilaudid, which brought me down to about a 5/5.5 out of 10, but it still hurt too much to breathe. They ended up putting me on oxygen because I was only taking short, shallow breaths and my O2 was at 91. They gave me a small dose of fentanyl and that brought my pain down to about a 3. I was moved to recovery.


In recovery, after about an hour, the pain got back up to about a 5 and they gave me 5mg oxy. Brought me back down to about a 3 which was manageable enough that I was able to get out of bed to pee. They told me that once they were in me with the robot they found out that the mass was ‚Äúmuch larger‚Äù than 10cm. I asked around but apparently the surgeon didn‚Äôt note the size in my chart so I will have to ask her at my next followup. They also said that the mass had already twisted the tube and cut off most of the blood supply. What we had thought would be a preemptive surgery was less than a week from becoming an emergency surgery. I am glad we made the choice to operate. 


I am still icing my everything. Now that I‚Äôm home, the worst pain so far has been muscle spasms in my upper abdomen. Those had me at about an 8/10 surprisingly enough. It was bad but ice helped a lot to calm them down. I have never whimpered in my life before those spasms today. My husband ordered me a heating pad on Amazon and is currently out at Walmart getting more ice packs to keep me comfortable. I could not have done this without him. 


So, all in all, surgery went well and was extremely good timing. A few hiccups along the way (one of the operating people jabbed themselves with one of my needles and I had to give extra blood for that), but overall, even though I‚Äôm in a pretty significant amount of pain and discomfort, I will say the feeling I have in my abdomen outside of the pain is like a pressure was relieved that I didn‚Äôt realize I had. Like I was bloated and didn‚Äôt have a clue. I am so grateful to my ultrasound tech for finding the mass, the OBGYN for putting in emergency referrals for me, my surgeon for expediting literally everything, and my husband for all of his support.",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,92697,public,self,Update Update: I can‚Äôt wait for next week,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/p3y0xi/update_update_i_cant_wait_for_next_week/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Just got back from one of my OB checks and I'm a little less than thrilled but my reaction could just be pregnancy hormones.  So I'm coming to you guys for advice. I am also a STM. 

First off I usually have to wait a half hour to be seen every appointment,  sometimes longer. I don't think I've ever been seen at my scheduled appointment time. When I do get seen it's usually less than 5 min for the whole thing. Just long enough to get BP and listen to babers on the doppler for 2 seconds. Then OB comes in,  says eveything is great and I leave. 

I've been unhappy with how quickly I've been ushered from the office for the last several visits but it hasn't been a big deal because I don't usually have many questions. Today, though, I had several and I got to ask only 2 because the OB kept trying to leave. I interrupted him a few times to ask my questions to stop him from literally walking out the door. It seemed like he was trying to get in and out as fast as humanly possible. 

Anyway the issue I'm having with today is my BP was high for me. I've been consistently around 116/70 my whole pregnancy but today I was 140/? ( I think it was 90 but I don't remember). On top of this Babers had an elevated heart rate of 174. I asked and he said that they neither were concerning. I'm probably overreacting but I feel uneasy with this appointment. When I was pregnant with my daughter they got concerned when my BP got up to 130 and they did a couple extra things to make sure that I wasn't developing high blood pressure. I ended up being okay and it was a fluke.

  Furthermore, I also had several episodes a week ago of a rapid heart rate waking me up from a dead sleep. I called in  and they said to watch it and all that should be in my notes too. So that,, along with the questions ( I keep feeling  like im leaking)  among others that I didn't get to ask is making me feel a little upset. He didn't measure my fundal height this appointment either and I was last seen 2 weeks ago. 

 I'm concerned that there is evidence that there may be an issue starting and its being ignored due to how busy this practice is. I have half a mind to call triage tomorrow to get seen again. 

But this could also be angry pregnant lady hormones so I thought I would ask you all. 

Is that a high heart rate for babers? Does this BP for me  warrant concern? Weird leaking feeling? Nothing that fills up a panty liner but still odd.

I have always wanted to wait till birth to find out the sex of my baby but my husband was eager to know, so we decided to find out during the NIPT test result. I got the call earlier this week. To my surprise and happiness, the lady said it‚Äôs a baby boy! My husband‚Äôs job involves flying, so I always imagined myself to have a baby girl, but I would genuinely have been happy either way. My husband is clearly disappointed because he wanted a girl after spending time with my 18m old niece.

What I did not expect was the negative reactions from both sides of our mothers. After announcing to my mother through video call, as she is currently overseas, she immediately mumbled to my sister about the baby girl clothings that I have stashed. To be fair, my 4yo ‚Äúhope basket‚Äù has mostly neutral clothings, with girl and boys clothings mixed in. My sister who has an 18m old girl, was supportive but out of no ill-will, still mentioned that first baby does not matter, we can always try for a girl next. Out of spite, I told her my husband only wants one kid.

Last night, we announced to my MIL face-to-face. She was elated at first, as she guessed right due to my husband‚Äôs side of the family‚Äôs trend, but followed on with remarks like ‚Äúit will be good if it‚Äôs a girl‚Äù. This is her first grandkid. BIL walked past commenting ‚Äúdon‚Äôt beat your son ah‚Äù, which I brushed off at first as his sense of humour. But now I wonder if he would have said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hit your daughter‚Äù if we were having a girl.

I feel like people who have girls firstborn have it easier, as no one will risk sounding like a misogynist by saying you can try for a boy next. Ironically, our grandparents‚Äô era has been known to favour boys over girls, being traditionally Chinese.

My birth preferences were IV painkillers,  intermittent or mobile monitoring, no induction, no epidural, most importantly not on my back! Did not happen like that. But I didn't tear much, only needed internal stitches, so all in all could've been better but pretty darn lucky.

Monday night I had a lot of what I thought were Braxton Hicks- felt like pretty normal period cramping. I was really fatigued. Bounced on my birth ball a lot.

Tuesday morning at 7:45 my water breaks. I was just sitting there, not really cramping much. I go to the bathroom and there's blood in the toilet. I call the practice hotline, they tell me to come in right away, confirm my water is broken but I'm not quite 1 cm dilated. The doctor over at LOD wants me to come in right away, says she'll be really hands off but because I tested positive for group B strep she wants to get me on penicillin for delivery every 4 hours. The doctor who examined me told me it was my choice, and since I was not very dilated I could go home as long as I was willing to come in by early evening.

So I went home. Bounced on the ball. The period cramp-like contractions had stopped by 3:30pm. We went into LOD at 5:30pm.

So here was the shitty part- This hospital has 2 mobile monitors, but when we arrived it turned out the disposable sticky papers that connect the monitors were OUT and on back order. And because of the strep and the broken water the doctor insisted on constant monitoring. And for some reason, even if I just shifted forward while sitting on the bed they couldn't get the heartbeat. So for them to actually monitor baby I had to stay pretty still, and not even lean forward. It was a position that made contractions, once I got induced, so much worse. Also, the way this doctor examined my cervix was sooooo painful. 

They gave me Cytotec at 7pm to try to get contractions going. Got the period cramp-like contractions back. At 9 they examined me, I wasn't even at 2 cm, they gave me a second dose. 

Then I got real contractions. And the position they needed me to be in in the bed was so unbearable. 

The doctor had said I'd get pitocin at 1pm. (She and the night nurse were pretty darn bad about telling me what was going to happen, instead of presenting choices. My husband was pretty awesome about speaking up for me and helping me speak up.) 

So by 11 I was in major pain, and we were trying to find a way to accommodate their need for the constant monitor with my need to move. I asked if we could skip the pitocin and what kind of progress I'd need to have made to do skip it. Doctor gave me an answer, but I don't remember it, it just seemed super unlikely with me having to stay pretty still on that bed. And the contractions were KILLER. I also needed to be attached to an IV for the penicillin. So on 2 different fronts my mobility was limited.

So I made the call the to get the IV painkillers, get an epidural, and go with the pitocin. Oh, during this time that I was having induced contractions and no painkillers my blood pressure was (unsurprisingly!) measuring high and that earned me an extra day in the hospital and a cuff that I have to use all this weekend to assure them I'm not pre-eclampsic.

I was super scared of getting the epidural, but honestly by the time I got it I was so grateful for the relief. Got it at 12pm, immediately fell asleep. Woke up at 3 feeling like I had to poop out a fiery cannonball. Call the nurse in, she tells me in this super unclear way that sensation is the baby's head. I have to clarify with her, wait how much of the baby's head is through my cervix? The answer was all of it. i was fully dilated. I ask if I can start pushing (really wanted to) and she tells me to wait till she's set up. 

I pushed for maybe 40 minutes. On my back, being given a lot more orders than I wanted. (Don't push in your face! Don't make noise! Push where you feel my fingers!) And then they ended up having to use the vacuum, so my baby boy came out looking SO FUNNY with a total conehead. (3 days later his head is totally normal, so don't be scared of that being permanent.)

But upsides- only needed some internal stitches. Took a poop the next day and it was fine. Baby boy is healthy and handsome. 

If I ever do this again I'm not going back to this particular hospital, which is rural and serves a fair amount of amish women. I think if I'd gone with an urban hospital the pressure to induce was still going to be there, but the monitoring options would have been available. And I think at an urban hospital the staff wouldn't have been SO directive.

But I would maybe get an epidural again? And I think I'd be open to a 39 week induction now that I've seen how quickly pitocin can open your dang cervix while you nap. 

So all in all a mixed bag. Not the empowered birth of my dreams, a very medicalized experience. One more day in the hospital than I think was necessary. BUT healthy baby, a pretty healthy crotch with no tears or cuts, I've pooped twice since and it hasn't been an emergency.

For the record I already feel like I‚Äôm cutting it close with the timing of my move. 

We discussed a color in the green family: Benjamin Moore‚Äôs mermaid green. 

Our crib and dresser is a dark gray. Storkcraft moss in gray &amp; marching dresser if you care to check. 

I made the mistake of showing my brother and the paint color we picked out. He ended up referring to it as ecstasy green. In his opinion the color is too bright and I‚Äôm going to blind the baby lol. This might sound mean but he really doesn‚Äôt mean anything by it. I made the mistake of asking his opinion. That‚Äôs on me üòÇ. 

Now I‚Äôm having second thoughts. We do also have teal crib sheets and a white bedspread with light teal/blue accents. So I‚Äôm not sure if the wall color plus the similar accents would be too much.

I am a G1P0 at 7 weeks gestational age by LMP. I am otherwise healthy. My dates could be off by two days (so I could be 6 weeks 5 days) but not more than that as I was tracking ovulation with ovulation prediction kits and basal body temperature.

Initial tests: I initially had beta HCG done at 4 weeks which came back a bit low at 56. Repeat beta HCG 72 hours later was 157 (doubling time 47 hours). 

At 5 weeks 6 days GA (by LMP): Subsequently I had a beta HCG done one week later and it was 8642 (doubling time 41 hours). I had an ultrasound done the same day (last Thursday) which showed a gestational sac corresponding with GA of 5 weeks 5 days (just one day less than 5 weeks 6 days which I should have been by LMP) but no definitive yolk sac, embryo or subchorionic hemorrhage.

Yesterday morning, I started having small amount of brown spotting after wiping. I did not have intercourse or other cervical trauma that could have caused the spotting. Then, I had no spotting rest of the day or overnight. This morning again I had some brown/red spotting. I should be 7 weeks GA by LMP today. I got an ultrasound done which showed a gestational sac, yolk sac and embryo measuring 6 weeks 1 day with a heart rate of 111 beats per minute. The CRL was 0.41 cm. This is 6 days smaller than I would expect based on my LMP. Even if I ovulated two days later than I thought it is still 4 days smaller than I would expect at this stage. The ultrasound also showed ""trace"" subchorionic hemorrhage and a 0.7 cm fibroid. My family doctor did a speculum exam and noted a closed cervix and a small amount of red blood mixed with mucus. Beta today is pending.

We're very anxious as this is our first (very wanted) pregnancy. Would appreciate any insight into the spotting and measuring almost a week smaller by CRL than what we would expect by LMP.

I‚Äôd had very swollen feet the whole pregnancy but it was noticeable different. I took a break and tried to elevate it for about an hour but there was no change. Left work around 4:30pm and decided to call my midwife‚Äôs office just to make sure it was nothing serious. I had an appointment schedule for the next morning so I assumed she would tell me to just come in the next day and we would check it out. Instead she told me to head into labor and delivery and get checked out just in case. I was pretty surprised.

I called my husband and explained what was going on. He left work early and met me at the house. I showered quick and kinda gathered my hospital bag. I was only about 70% packed but figured I wasn‚Äôt having this baby today (lol) and decided to leave it. My husband assured me he would come back for it if something happened. Neither of us are convinced by this point I was going to be having the baby.

Get to labor and delivery around 5:30pm and was admitted into a labor and delivery room. At this point we‚Äôre like ‚Äúokay a little surprising but they do this with everyone‚Äù.
Then the nurse comes in and asks me to put on a gown and get comfortable in the bed. Totally surprised I blurted ‚ÄúAm I having this baby now?‚Äù She responded depending on how the tests come back they may decide to induce because I am at 37 weeks today. My husband was not impressed lol. We both freak a little when she walked out. 

So I give a urine sample and then hooked up to a blood pressure cuff and hang out in bed trying to wrap my head around what‚Äôs going on. Around 7:00pm they take me down to ultrasound to take a look at my leg to make sure there isn‚Äôt a blood clot causing the excessive swelling in my leg. After the ultrasound the tech said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything here for you to worry about but the doctor will be in touch.‚Äù Huge relief because I thought that meant I‚Äôd be going home.

Get back up to the room and tell my husband that I think we were in the clear. 10 minutes later the nurse walks in and says ‚ÄúSo there are proteins in your urine and your blood pressure is elevated. The doctor is recommending induction tonight because you are at 37 weeks and showing symptoms of preeclampsia.‚Äù Definitely not what we were expecting! My husband literally jumped out of his seat. Important until this point I had a very uneventful and easy pregnancy.  She told us to take a minute to decide. I asked if there was any chance of going home tonight and coming back in the morning. Doctor said not recommended because there is a strong chance I could suffer a seizure or stroke.

So we buckled in and decide it was time to have this baby! Husband ran home and tried his best to finish packing my bag and bring everything I needed.  Nurse started to induce me with a suppository. First cervical check was a 1cm around 8:30pm. We slept the night and they check me every 4 hours to see if I was progressing. The suppository was not effective and they decide to start me on Pitocin. 

Still no progression so at noon on the 3rd my midwife decided to break my waters. That was the strangest sensation. Like a huge bucket of hot water coming out of me. 

Within 15 minutes contractions started. First slow and manageable but then they grew stronger and stronger and closer together. After 2 hours of contraction I called for an epidural. Best decision ever. I was at 3.5cm by this point. It was difficult staying still during contractions while it was being inserted, but once it was in it took about 20 minutes for the pain to subside completely. So well that I slept for a couple hours.

I woke up because I started to feel some pain again. Pushed the button that made the drip start up again. Didn‚Äôt really help and I started having big urge to push. Called the nurse and said I feel like it‚Äôs time to push.  She checked and I was at 9.5cm. Blown away by how fast I progressed.

5 minutes later it was time to start pushing. I could feel the contractions through the epidural which made pushing really easy I thought. Painful and a lot of pressure but not unbearable. Within 40 minutes baby boy was born. Everyone was amazed at how fast I was able to push him out. 

Worst part was probably the stitches. I had a 2nd degree tear from his shoulder catching. Even with the epidural and local anesthetic I could still feel the sting. But I was holding this beautiful baby and it was hard to let it bother me. 

Baby was 6lbs 0oz and 19.5inches. He was perfectly healthy for being 3 weeks early. We‚Äôve had an easy transition into parenthood.

Overall really positive experience, even though it started out surprising and a little scary. My nurses were some of the most amazing and supportive ladies. 

If you made it this far, I hope you have just as positive of an experience. I was terrified of birth and I realized after that I had made it out to be way worse than it actually ended up being.

Through my first trimester, I have been nauseous 2-3 times a day or so, with each nausea episode soon leading me to throwing up and being fine for a while.

For the past week or so, I have just been throwing up before lunch. This makes sense, nausea often tends to die down near the end of the first trimester. I have not missed throwing up, though, before lunch since I've begun noticing this pattern. My theory the other day was that my hormones are highest after having breakfast in the morning (I woke up late today). I throw up like 30 minutes to an hour after having breakfast.

My fish oil I take is for Omega 3s, and I just recently burped up a little fish oil taste (I have burpless tablets, but it doesn't always work perfectly). Soon after that is when my nausea I had already been feeling went over the edge, and I had to throw up.

My theory now is that I think my fish oil supplement is what is making me sick. Before it was just a general pregnancy symptom since I threw up more often, but now I think the fish oil is setting me over the edge. And I do usually end up throwing up the fish oil (but not my prenatal or vitamin D pill for some reason)...

Since I threw it up this morning, I guess I should take another one with lunch and see if this is indeed what is making me be sick, because I haven't  thrown up at any other time in a week or two... I also had to do an experiment on my skin recently to see if I was having a bad reaction to my acne cleanser, and it seems so...

I‚Äôm also so tired of the hustle to get work. I just want to have a career where I make a salary and know each week a pay check will be coming in.

I've been through some dark moments this pregnancy, mentally and financially, it has been hard since I'm alone in another country, my family lives in Venezuela and I live in Spain, but what has kept me going is this LO inside of me, what has made me fight and be hopeful.

So, ''River'' by Eminem I listened to it for the first time while I was still with my Baby Daddy (22M), and it just hit me just how much similar to my story it was, specially the monologue part of the video. At that time I showed it to my ex and we basically both cried because it was literally our situation, but with me demanding nothing from him but for him to be faithful while I was pregnant for the baby because he had chosen to stay.

So, yeah, now almost everytime my Youtube Music Playlist plays this song I just can't skip it and I cry, I cry because I remember the pain of those 4 months of someone who can't see such a gift of life, someone who tried to hurt me so much just so I abort, someone who even was used to hurting himself with no control over his addiction, someone who the idea of a baby was so bad that he was willing to hurt me in any way so to make sure my baby boy is never born, because for him it was never a person, a being, just an obstacle... but for me he is my whole world and I don't even know him yet, he knew I wanted to be a mom, he knew I had issues getting pregnant and he trusted that (honestly, it was a big surprise, what with his drug record and my obesity at the time and PCOS) but it happen, and for me, if it happened it was because of a reason and I never asked nothing from him but love and being a team.

We don't talk anymore, he wrote me for the last time when I was 8 months drunk after work in the afternoon because he basically wanted to fuck (he hadn't wrote me in 4 months)... I asked him that if he doesn't want to know anything about baby, then don't write me, don't think about me, to leave us alone. He has done it so far. I moved as well and he doesn't know where we live. His family knows about the baby but they don't care, I think they think it's not his, and honestly I think that's for the better, if you knew them, you'd understand why my BD is so broken...

It's not all bad tho, I have a wonderful (gay) best friend who will be the male role model for my baby if needed be, I have support from my family even if they are far away, I work from home, I have 3 dogs and a Cat and some financial stability with a lot of debts but who doesn't? specially with a baby haha.

I'm just hopeful now, but sometimes it's good to cry for the pain one has endured.

I was a SAHM for 8 years and have recently gone back to work full time as my 3.5yo is 12 months away from starting primary school. It's an amazing job and the employer is paying for me to become a fully qualified accountant.

I've just found out that I'm about 5 weeks pregnant.

My OH is adamant we can't have this baby, we are on the home stretch, I've just got an amazing job and a new baby will affect the whole family. Finances will obviously take a massive hit. Although my salary at present is only covering the childcare costs; roughly ¬£17k for the preschooler and school clubs for the older ones. I thought it would be worth it in the long run as I'd get qualified and youngest would be starting school within a year. I had originally applied for an apprenticeship but was offered a job.

I'm torn. I have always said I will never have a termination. However I am struggling to come to terms with being pregnant and how I'll lose my job and go back to being a SAHM for the next 5 years. If I was to return to work after maternity childcare costs would soar to ¬£25k a year, making it impossible to go back to work.

I'd need to let my employer know soon as I'm due to start college in a few weeks! Has anyone else been in this situation and have any advice for me? If I didn't have my job then I probably wouldn't even be questioning my life. But it's all starting to come together.

I know I got myself into this situation, I've been begging OH to get the snip for years as my body doesn't tolerate contraception very well. He might well now have an excuse to get it done!!

I am a 35 y/o FTM. I had discussed induction with my dr after reading some information about getting induced at 39 weeks. We made a plan that would depend on the condition of my cervix since my pregnancy was luckily complication free except that I was AMA. She also didn‚Äôt want me going over 41 weeks. My cervix wasn‚Äôt dilated at all but was 70% effaced, soft and midpoint by my due date and we scheduled the induction for 2 days ago (which was coincidentally the start of a heat wave, good for us to not be in my hot house)

I got to the hospital at 7am with my husband. They did all the intake stuff and I met with the OB and after a cervical check we made a plan to use misoprostal (Cytotec) to ripen my cervix and to see how things progress. 

I got 2 doses (intervaginal) the first at 11 and started to have contractions around 5pm. Things picked up from there and were pretty uncomfortable. I had another cervical check around 8 and the dr confirmed that I was around 3 cm dilated and we could break my water. Due to reading many of other users stories I asked for my epidural before we broke my water and I‚Äôm glad I did!

The epidural wasn‚Äôt bad to put in and omg it took away all my contraction pain. It did make my blood pressure too low though. They had to give me a few doses of medication to get me back to where I needed to be. I think I went into it being a little dehydrated and that may have contributed to it.

I rested all night and had a peanut ball to keep my hips open. My nurse was fantastic, also. I felt a building pressure in my rectal area (I didn‚Äôt imagine it would feel that way but there ya go) and it looked like I was ready to push. I started pushing around 545 and and she came out at 636! Right before shift change for my OB and nurse I had for the overnight. They were excited they didn‚Äôt miss it. I have a second degree tear and the baby was 8.3 lbs! 

All are healthy over here! I thought that the induction process was going to take longer but I had a 24 hour turnaround with around a 13 labor.

Recently me and my boyfriend did sexual things but did not have sex. He masturbated first and got sperm on his hands but he wiped his hands with a napkin immediately. He did touch my left hand after wiping his hands (his hands were dry), but then he got up and washed his hands but I didn‚Äôt wash mine. But I don‚Äôt recall ever touching myself with my hands in this time frame. About 20 minutes later he touched me in between my legs, but I had underwear on and on top of that I also had bike shorts on. He never touched me directly, only on the outside of my clothing. He rubbed me on the outside of my clothes and I finished and that was all that has occurred. He never directly touched my vagina. I am experiencing extreme stress over the possibility that I somehow got pregnant from this. I‚Äôm not on birth control at all. I also have bad anxiety issues and have had anxiety my entire life. I have had extreme stress recently and now (about 10 days after this happened) I have started what I think is my period. My period started on day 30 but my period normally starts on day 30-35 so I don‚Äôt think this is an irregularity for me. However, my period has been lighter than it ever has been but it‚Äôs too heavy to be spotting. I am currently on my second day and it is a little lighter than my first day. But I am having more stress on my second day. The blood is red mixed with a little brown. On my first day it took about 4 hours to fill up a regular tampon. (This was when it was heaviest). Typically my period fills a super tampon every 2-4 hours on day one. I have also been extremely stressed during this time due to my anxiety about the situation and I have only slept 1-2 hours a night for the past 3 days. I‚Äôm shaking a lot and have been nauseous and barely eating. I am also underweight, I am 91 pounds and am about 5‚Äô2.5‚Äù.

Currently pregnant with baby number three and I‚Äôm 37w+2. Pregnancy has been ok so far until the past week. I am in the most awful and irritable mood. 

Little background: Husband and I have two kids age 10(M) and 11(F). I joke that this is our midlife crisis baby although he was certainly planned. Husband started a new job last month (better pay &amp; etc). He works in engineering and I am an ICU RN. Covid is ramping up again and it makes me super nervous. I spend 12 hour shifts in what feels like a garbage bag. My commute to and from work each day is roughly 2 hours. I used to work all my days in a row. Then I went to two on, one off and one on. Now I work every other day because I cannot handle being on my feet that long two days in a row anymore. 

On my off days this past week, I lay in bed but I can‚Äôt sleep and I‚Äôm just pissy and tired. No energy to do anything. Every bark from the dogs, every comment and fight I hear with the kids and even my husband telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre pregnant, it‚Äôs ok to feel crappy‚Äù just pisses me off to no end. I try my best to not be snappy and to brush it all off, but it is really starting to bother me. 

Baby room is all done and bags are packed. I just want to feel normal again. My other two pregnancies were a breeze and didn‚Äôt bother me a bit. I am so uncomfortable and irritable. My husband keeps insisting I go ahead and begin FMLA, but I refuse. I want my full 12 weeks at home once baby boy is here. Only 5 weeks will be paid as that‚Äôs all the PTO I have saved, but I refuse to go back early in the middle of Covid. I kept my kids online with school last year the entire time. They are begging me to go back this year and I just don‚Äôt know. Anyone else struggling with sending kids back to school with Covid numbers going up and a newborn coming soon?

I'm 23, a FTM, 19w+5 and yesterday my husband and I found out that we're having a baby boy! We were super excited and decided to share the gender news with our closer friends and family as they too were super excited to find out. We sent out a few texts, emails and phone calls to the people who we wanted to tell.

Now my birth mother and I don't have the closest relationship - I wont go too into depth about that - but I've seen her twice in the past 15 years. I told her about the pregnancy as I felt that she should hear it from me, and she's been very excited for ""her"" grand baby...

We waited months before we publicly announced the pregnancy to begin with. After we did announce, she asked me if she was now allowed to post about it. I reluctantly said yes and she did. In regards to the gender announcement, we decided that we didn't want a huge reveal but that we were eventually going to do a simple and nice little picture reveal for the rest of our family/friends that we hadn't personally told yet, and for good memories to look back on. 

I decided to send a text over to my biological mom this morning with the new ultrasound picture and the gender. She never asked about how the anatomy/20 week ultrasound went. About an hour later, I see my ultrasound picture up on her facebook, informing everyone that she's expecting a grandson. Considering I hadn't even posted my ultrasound nor mentioned anything to do with the gender of my baby on any social media, I immediately messaged her again and asked her to take it down as we were planning on announcing it ourselves, when we're ready. She deleted it and replied ""Oh I thought it would be ok since we have different friends on our facebook"". We do in fact have a few mutual friends and tons of family, who talk and spread things like wildfire.

My baby boy was due 8/7. My whole pregnancy he was measuring weeks ahead for his size and in the 99th percentile for overall size as well as head size, even though I had no pre-existing health problems that would cause him to be larger (like gestational diabetes). He‚Äôs just naturally a big boy! Although these are just estimates, my doctor and I decided it would be best to go ahead and set an induction date for when I was at 39+3 to make the odds a little better of him not getting a shoulder stuck on the way out and delivery being a little easier on my body. I really wanted to do everything I could to avoid a c section. I was pretty bummed about having an induction because I really wanted to experience spontaneous labor, but I knew for me that induction was the best option. On the evening of 7/27 around 7pm when I was 38+3 I was in my kitchen canning and pickling veggies from my garden, when all of a sudden a little gush of water hit the floor and got my underwear wet. I honestly just thought I peed myself. I tried to recreate the leakage by moving in different ways and doing lunges, walking up and down stairs, etc. When none of those things did anything, I determined there was no way my water broke and I kept working on canning. My husband was at the store when this happened and when I told him about it when he got home, he became super cautious as he knows how dismissive I can be. I reassured him that it was not the day the baby was going to come. Well, we finished up what we were doing and made dinner. I went to the bathroom and was walking to the couch to eat when all of a sudden I felt my sweatpants get wet again. Now I‚Äôm thinking this could be the real deal, because I just emptied my bladder! I went back to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet, and sure enough the water started flowing! I was clenching my muscles as if holding in my pee and the water was still coming out steadily, so I knew this was it. I said ‚Äúbabe‚Äù from the bathroom, and my husband immediately knew. He got all excited and came in the room and said ‚Äúthis is it, isn‚Äôt it!‚Äù I called my doctor to confirm that I should go in to the hospital and she said to definitely make it there in the next hour or 2. Luckily we only live 15 mins from the hospital so I took my time eating my dinner and off we went. 

We arrived at midnight and got checked into triage where they checked my cervix. I was only 1 cm dilated and while they were doing the exam, I soaked the poor nurse with my water so she had no doubt that my water had broken. They hooked me up to the monitors and I learned that I had been having contractions pretty consistently, I just couldn‚Äôt feel them. Now looking back, I believe I had been in early labor for about a week but I thought the contractions were either baby head pressure or poop pains! We sat in triage until about 3am when a delivery room finally opened up. 

At 4am when I was still at 1cm we decided that the next best thing to do was the foley bulb before pitocin. They inserted it which wasn‚Äôt too bad, but holy crap did I start to feel the contractions! She warned me it would make them worse with the bulb inserted. It was manageable though, and the bulb finally fell out at 7am when I reached 4cm. I immediately felt like a million bucks and the contractions were painless once it was out. 


We waited until 9am to see if my body would progress more on it‚Äôs own, and when it didn‚Äôt, I was started on the pitocin. This, of course, ramped up my contractions. I tried bouncing on a birthing ball and laboring in different positions to ease the pain, but I only lasted until noon when I asked for the epidural. It would have been manageable, but my contractions were coming every 1.5-2 mins and lasting 30-45 seconds, so I wasn‚Äôt getting a break. They had to keep altering the dose of pitocin since my contractions were so close together, I forget the term for my uterus but essentially it wasn‚Äôt spacing the contractions out far enough even though I was still only 5cm. The anesthesiologist arrived about 15 mins after I asked for the epidural and he was so amazing. The placement only felt like a bee sting and I felt immediate relief. I could still move my legs but felt absolutely no pain. From noon to 2am the next morning is a blur. I spent a lot of time sleeping and eating popsicles. I was so hungry! 

There were 2 occasions when baby‚Äôs head had shifted against my spine and I felt intense pain at one point in my lower back and another time in my left hip, so the anesthesiologist came back in to up my dose. The pain was so bad it had me in tears and I was saying I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could do this. The increase in dosage had the pain go away but it took away all movement in my legs. The nurse used a peanut ball and kept moving my position to help my pelvis open up and help me dilate. It worked because at 2:30am I was ready to start pushing. 

Pushing is hard work! I was lucky, though, because my epidural was working so well. I really didn‚Äôt feel a thing. I didn‚Äôt even feel the pressure. The nurse monitored my contractions and told me exactly how and when to push. It took a while to get his big noggin past my pelvic bone, but it was easy once that was done. I was loopy at this point so it‚Äôs a little foggy looking back. Eventually my husband looks at me and says ‚Äúone more push and he‚Äôs here!‚Äù and I could feel the doctor pulling him to help him come out. The relief of pressure once he was out was immense. They put him on my chest and started wiping him down and I could see her starting to stitch me up, still no pain. The moment I saw him for the first time was a moment I wish I could relive over and over again. The happiness my husband and I felt just isn‚Äôt comparable to anything else. 

What came next is the worst part. I‚Äôm a natural red head. The nurse had warned me that redheads tend to hemorrhage more often than anyone else. (Side note- I got lucky that I had a perfect epidural because red heads also tend to also not respond the same to anesthesia). After my placenta was out, they did the fundal massage and I was bleeding heavily. I passed a large clot that spooked the doctor so she decided to do a manual extraction of my uterus. I didn‚Äôt see any of this go down, I didn‚Äôt want to see any of the gore or details but my husband was a trooper and watched the whole thing so he was able to give me a play by play when I was ready. During the extraction, the doctor was literally elbow deep inside of me pulling out the clots and pressing hard on my stomach at the same time. This was The. Most. Painful! experience of the whole labor. Epidural was still on but the pain was further up in my abdomen and I have never experienced anything like it. 0/10 would not recommend.  It was over fast enough and I was wheeled to the recovery room. 

Overall, my labor experience was great and I consider myself extremely lucky. 30 hour labor and 2 hours of pushing. They did have to give me antibiotics due to going past the 24 hour mark after my water had broken but this was simply out of precaution. 

My little dude was born 10 lbs 6 oz and 21.5 inches long at 38+5, completely healthy. I had a minor 2nd degree tear of my perineum and a small tear of my bilateral labia that required a few stitches. I consider this a HUGE win with his size. Recovery has been better than I expected with minor pain and I already feel mostly back to normal at almost 2 weeks post delivery. Baby boy is doing great after a short stint of jaundice that required us to get a light therapy blanket for him at home 2 days after we got home from the hospital. Now that he‚Äôs better, he‚Äôs a great sleeper and we actually have to wake him up at night to feed him. He goes down at 11, we wake him up at 3am and 7am to eat while taking turns so each of us gets a solid amount of sleep. Our pediatrician says in 2 weeks we can stop waking him up and let him tell us when he‚Äôs hungry at night. 

I always doubted having children was for me, but every ounce of that doubt vanished the second I met my little dude.

This topic isn't relevant for me at all right now, but I'm curious, and I couldn't find a better subreddit for this question.
I still haven't decided if I want to have a child in a natural way, but if I end up doing so, I'm worried about one thing. What if my child ends up being really heavy at birth?
I'm on the thinner side, with 50kg (110~ lbs) and 163cm (5'3~). Does this mean my child would be smaller too? Since my body is smaller, my child won't be too heavy for me, I assume?
My mom's body type was quite the opposite from mine, when she gave birth to my brother, who was born with more than 4000g (8,8~ lbs). Does this have a correlation?

He had a birthday party, and his parents weren't there, they were out.
 My boyfriend, (let's name him Zack) bought some alcoholic drinks to the party, so it could be more exciting. 
 We started drinking a lot, until we got drunk. Then we went upstairs.. 
 At that time I was conscious, but he was not. He started kissing me, until ""it"" was done
 After 2-3 weeks later, I started having morning sickness, so I went to the supermarket and got a pregnancy test.
 It was positive. I took more, and still positive. After that, I called Zack, to tell him I was pregnant. He told me that he didn't want a child, especially with me, and that he was just playing. He also told me that he was with another girl and he hang up. 
 After that I never talked about that while my pregnancy. My parents didn't know about this. I hid my pregnancy for 9 months successfully, but then it was time to give birth to my baby. 
 My mother after I gave birth told me that she knew I was pregnant, but I still don't understand how, but anyways. 
 While I was pregnant, my best friend, Serena, was always by my side. Some months later, when I was 5 months, she asked me to be her girlfriend. I obviously said yes, and we started dating. 
 When I gave birth, I found out that it was a girl. Me and Serena decided to name her Miracle.
 Serena loved Paula, even though she wasn't her child.

I paid a professional stranger to rub and poke me for 75 minutes and it was worth every single penny. 

The physical relief is significant - my neck and back had settled into an 'abnormal normal' to the point where I wasn't even aware how solid my shoulders were. Mentally, taking some time to do this was great. I didn't have an epiphany or feel like I'd achieved enlightenment, but I had time to think, to listen to the plinkyplonky pan pipe music, I told him I wouldn't want to talk. Not checking my phone, or email, or feeling like I should be doing something for an hour or so was incredible. 

He was conscious of making me feel comfortable, leaving the room so I could get comfortable, then turning around when I was shifting about like a beached whale from one side the other. He told me what to expect. He checked in at the start so he could address problem areas. He checked the pressure. Thank goodness he was feeling strong today.

My aunt asking loudly, in public, if my husband is going to get ""snipped after this one?"" People around us heard  cause they looked like they felt awkward too. Now it's not that i mind the question per say. But first off I'm a very private person. I didnt even feel comfortable announcing on social media that I was pregnant this time around. I privately messaged friends and family who I knew who be genuinely excited and not just nosey. Secondly it was the way in which she said it. The tone was "" you have your hands full and look overwhelmed there's no way you'd want more"". And she also did a laugh after saying it like im totally down to go ""get my spouse snipped"" ok...so much wrong with that. First off...its his body. And again I'm very private why would I want to discuss that in public let alone with her, which honestly we are close, but not like that anymore.
 Now you're probably wondering, ""ok how many kids does this person have..."" I have 1. Just 1. Hes 4 going on 5 very shortly. Yes he is a handful. He has adhd and sensory problems which makes a lot of things we do...harder. ok fine. We still wanted to give him a sibling. Our choice. And honestly that in itself was a very long journey. We had wanted the kids to be close in age and in the process found out I have more fertility issues than realized. Don't even get me started on that. I'm now close to 30 which is the ONLY reason they finally listened to me...anyways neither here nor there but what I would like to know is why does my husband need to go get snipped just cause we finally had a second kid. Why. It took us so much struggling to even get the second kid. Is two the secret number? No shame to anyone that has and only wants 2 kids. That's great. That's what works for you. But my husband and i(WHO HONESTLY IS THE ONLY TWO THAT IT REALLY MATTERS) have already discussed that we at least want 1 more. We both grew up in biggish families. I had 2 siblings he had 3. It's just natural to us. That's what we want. So did I smile and ignore her? No. My stupid butt answered. And I said ""no we actually want one more"" to which she rolled her eyes and then died laughing. In public. I would also like to mention that in general I am socially awkward, so I awkwardly laughed and said""guess I'm crazy...."" which yes I'm aware didn't help at all and made her laugh more but I was so embaressed. It popped out. Also being 26 weeks +6days pregnant didn't help. I'm glad I didn't start crying. Ok.. that's all. I felt pissed off and thought I'd rant here, maybe see if you guys are getting shamed for wanting more kids already or maybe getting shamed for not wanting anymore.  You know I also got chastised for not giving giving my son a sibling long before I was even pregnant with this one. And to just get people to leave me alone and because I didn't not want to discuss my fertility issues with them I would say we're happy how things are or maybe later on. Then they would tell me he's getting to old and I needed to give him a sibling right then and there.... ok thanks.. your words impregnated me. It worked. Super. Just be excited for someone as is. It's their life. Let them live it. 1 and done? Great. 10 kids? Sure works for you. No kids? Thats awesome.

The last couple of weeks I've been just getting through day to day, still in pain and the codeine can take the edge off but I'm hesitant to take it so only take it if I can't do the pain anymore. 

Today I've woken up with horrible pain in my back and from hip to hip (the ob says this is SPD and 'normal') as well as a stabbing/shooting pain in my left upper quadrant. I'm waiting test results from a liver profile as I've been really itchy. 

My migraines have been horrendous in pregnancy, to the point I can't move, I get visual disturbances, and I'm sick from the pain. I'm also anaemic and have been getting dizzy and passing out. 

I know I'm growing a baby, and it's going to be uncomfortable and there's bound to be growing pains, but surely it isn't supposed to be debilitating pain that nothing helps.

Now, we've been discussing this extensively over the last year, looked at our savings, paid off any debt we had, and my husband got a position that sets us up very well specifically for dealing with the medical costs of having a child. Together we make enough money to live and save comfortably. After my pregnancy, and because of our careful plan and substantial savings, I plan on staying home with baby for around a year. 

I can do all the research and planning and over preparing I want, but none of that can assuage my fear of how people will look at me. I do not have a degree yet, and although I've always thought of become a nurse, I've been working as a medical aid and find less and less that I want to pursue the long road of difficult school and likely thousands of dollars of debt for a job with extreme liability, hours, and burnout statistics. My job is also very family friendly, which is where my husband and I have always had our priorities. We both have a huge passion for children and always knew we wanted to start our family as soon as WE knew we could. 

 I don't have a healthy relationship with my side of the family, and rarely if ever speak to even my immediate family members. I know when they find out that I'm pregnant, at best, they'll try to offer awful but at least supportive advice, but at worst I'm terrified they'll tell me they think I'm being stupid, which would confirm my biggest anxieties - again, despite careful planning and constant reconfirmation that our savings and cash flow were enough. The fear about my family's reaction is bleeding over into a fear of how my coworkers will look at me, considering they're all 8+ years older women with degrees and a different definition of comfortable living than us. I do know that his family will be delighted, as they were asking about babies before we were even married lol. But I guess I feel like it's just one more life milestone heartbreak that I desperately don't want to experience.

We bought a house in January 2020. The idea was get a dog asap and then if everything goes well, we start trying to get pregnant within a year. After a few month she went off her birth control. We both discussed it and i was 100% consenting to it.

Now, 19 months later, shes 10 day late, shes been sick twice for absolutely no reason and she is complaining about breast tenderness.

I asked her many time to book an appointment  with her doctor, but she has refused to do so. Her excuse is ""I dont like to set up appointment"" and over our relationship its always been true.  I always ordered when we get food delivered. She told me ""dont be stupid"" In March 2021 she became burnt out of her job as a medical custodian.  Her employment condition and work load got 10x worst but her benefit barely moved. She dicscussed it with me and i agreed she needed a brealk. Her doctor prescribed her sertraline and buproprion and it hasnt messed up her menstrual cycle since.

Last night, she asked me ""Arent you freaked out I might be pregnant?"" My answer was ""I wouldnt be freaked since the day you got off your birth control pill""

I think she is freaked out and shes trying to avoid the topic as most as possible, we did 2 birth control test. The first one 3 day after she was late and the second one 10 days after.  Both are negative, but all the outward sign of pregnancy i was thought in healthy class are there. Am i in the wrong for pushing her to go see a doctor?

Apologies in advance, this is long and I‚Äôm on mobile. 

In a month and a half, we‚Äôll be doing a long distance move (MA to NC). My parents (who are vaccinated) are flying up to help us load the Uhaul and my dad is driving the Uhaul while my husband and I drive our car and pets. 

The tricky part is that my parents need a ride to the airport to get here. The airport is 2.5 hours from where they live. The only two options they have for people to drive them are unvaccinated anti-maskers. The town they live in currently has a huge spike in COVID and I only imagine it will get worse in the coming weeks. 

My husband and I are concerned about them being in the car with unmasked, unvaccinated people for 2.5 hours just a few hours before coming to our home to help us load the Uhaul (and staying in our apartment for a night). They totally understand where we‚Äôre coming from and have said they‚Äôll wear masks around us and use hand sanitizer, etc., but I just fear they could still transmit COVID to us. I‚Äôm particularly concerned as a pregnant person (I‚Äôll be 25 weeks then). My husband and I are both vaccinated as well, but with a suppressed immune system due to pregnancy, I‚Äôm worried. 

The town my parents live in is quite rural, so there‚Äôs no taxi or bus option. We‚Äôve looked into hiring movers instead, but we don‚Äôt have the extra estimated $6,000-8,000 for that. 

I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday and I‚Äôll be getting his medical opinion then. In the meantime, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has ideas that we haven‚Äôt considered yet (or any studies/insight on the transmission of COVID on car rides).

We had a brief period where we were a bit relaxed after getting vaccinated and returned back to social distancing once delta hit.  Our second born is due in a few months (October) and I am so conflicted on how to address child care for our first born when I deliver.  I didn‚Äôt take any chances when COVID first hit and now more than ever I feel the need to isolate since Delta is more dangerous for kids and everyone around us is basically ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù since they are protected/vaccinated.  I just can‚Äôt see myself leaving our son with anyone at this point. 

This past year and a half has honestly been extremely lonely because I could barely get anyone to social distance/quarantine when our son was first born and that was BEFORE vaccines.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I am grateful for the protection and to be vaccinated myself, but it‚Äôs like to everyone around us is blind to breakthrough cases and how vulnerable children are right now.  That being said, although we have many volunteers, I know no one in our circle would be willing to quarantine before birth, especially because I would ideally like to have them quarantine the whole month in case I deliver early again.

Covid aside, I‚Äôve never left our son with anyone except my husband due to social distancing, so I don‚Äôt have trust built up with anyone else at this point.  The amount of pushback I‚Äôve gotten with safety protocols and boundaries I have had in the past make me unsure that family would even respect the routine we‚Äôve created or even keep their mask on when over if asked.  It‚Äôs unfortunate but true.  Between how I‚Äôve seen positive cases handled in our circle, lack of transparency, and by falsely labeling everything as ‚Äúquarantining‚Äù and ‚Äústaying in our bubble‚Äù; this past year and a half has been one big validation that I‚Äôve been right to be cautious.  

The hospital staff member I spoke with predicts no visitors (besides one support person) will be allowed regardless of testing or vaccination status around my due date.  That ruins the slim hope I had of bringing our 1 year old to the hospital.  At this point, I want to eliminate any chance of covid entering our bubble, especially with another newborn and avoid stress/anxiety by delivering alone and having my husband stay home with our son.  My husband is absolutely heartbroken, but I feel like I have no options.  I know it will be scary, but the thought of leaving him with anyone else or possibly exposing him to covid terrifies me more.  

Is anyone else in a similar predicament?  Or have any advice?  Or words of comfort?  Anything?

I was told they‚Äôd hydrate me with IV fluids and recheck my fluid level in the morning and induce me if it hadn‚Äôt gone up significantly. I told them I‚Äôd prefer to just begin the induction that night or do it in the morning regardless of my fluid level because I know I‚Äôll go home and worry about it until my scheduled induction date. They said they were short staffed and didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd end up doing. 

I finally fell asleep at about 4am and my nurse came in right after that to tell me they were moving me to an L&amp;D room to begin my induction! We packed up our room and moved and I was checked for the first time and found to be 3cm dilated and very thinned out. So I was happy and they said we‚Äôd probably go straight to pitocin and skip the miso. Then my nurse came back and said triage suddenly got slammed and they couldn‚Äôt start the pitocin due to staffing. I was a bit frustrated but wanted to get some rest, sadly that didn‚Äôt happen but I assumed that when day shift came on they‚Äôd start my induction. 

Well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs now almost 2pm, I was brought over for my induction to start 10 hours ago and have been admitted for 24hrs. Every hour or two there‚Äôs a new excuse for why they can‚Äôt start the pitocin, always after I‚Äôm promised a specific time where they‚Äôll start it, most recently I was told at noon they‚Äôd start which didn‚Äôt happen. It seems that I‚Äôm at the very bottom of the list of who gets to go next despite how long I‚Äôve waited and despite having a pretty serious medical reason to be induced. 

I realize they‚Äôre low on staff but I‚Äôm losing my patience and have not slept at all in about 35 hrs, I have been sleeping poorly for weeks, and I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted. They also won‚Äôt let me go home because of my low fluid level. How do I advocate for myself in this situation? I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole but I feel like I‚Äôm being set up for failure..I‚Äôm already completely exhausted (and so is my husband) and I‚Äôm not even in active labor. Every couple hours I‚Äôm having NST‚Äôs and vitals and I‚Äôm on IV fluids so I have to pee as soon as I get close to falling asleep. I‚Äôm seriously worried that I‚Äôm not going to have the energy for a vaginal delivery if they keep jerking me around which I‚Äôve communicated to my nurse.

Thought I‚Äôd never see the day where I would graduate but it finally came üò≠ super long post ahead :)

I had scheduled for an elective induction at my 39 week mark. OB told me that if they didn‚Äôt have room (medical inductions, obv spontaneous labor) I would be bumped. Well, I didn‚Äôt realize how many days I would be bumped. Four days of calling everyday and it was the same news ‚Äúsorry, we don‚Äôt have room. Call back tomorrow‚Äù. It was extremely frustrating because every day felt SO long, especially having to wait until 4pm or 8pm to call. Well, Saturday morning the head charge nurse called me to say that another location a 50 minute drive could take me. OH YEAH hubby we‚Äôre doing that drive to get this baby out! 


We arrive at 1pm.

2pm: midwife checked my cervix and said it was pretty far back. Not dilated. She recommended I soften my cervix by taking cytotec and then a foley balloon later.
 
They hooked me up to the baby heart rate monitor and to monitor my contractions. Around 3pm, I had to go to the bathroom (y‚Äôall, this is a big thing when you have so much stuff to do when you‚Äôre hooked up just to pee!). Well, when I came back from bathroom and we hooked me back up, baby‚Äôs heart rate dropped a little. We think it detected my heart rate instead. But the nurse was being cautious so they didn‚Äôt give me the cytotec yet. This was at 4pm (literally three hours of doing nothing yet). But! She said I was having some contractions anyways. I had no idea. Just felt a little pressure or thought that baby is moving‚Ä¶ nothing bad at all. All the way until 5pm.

515pm: Got dinner. Nurse gave me some fluids to ‚Äúmove me along‚Äù so that she could give me the cytotec. Feeling a bit of contractions, completely manageable. 

630pm: Nurse giving me some juice to elicit some movement from baby.

653pm: Nurse FINALLY gave me half the cytotec. The midwife later comes in and was like ‚Äúumm you should‚Äôve been given this hoooours ago. I apologize.‚Äù Better safe than sorry I guess. This is the point where I personally consider labor starting because I was just waiting around on my bed before this.

10pm: Felt some contractions. Not so bad. Still just feels like baby is moving (around abdomen area). Only one that felt really like cramps below. But still completely tolerable. 

1015pm: Midwife said that because baby had a dip in heart rate from earlier, they wouldn‚Äôt give another cytotec just in case. Instead, they would attempt to put the foley balloon in because cervix is pretty soft and I‚Äôm .5 cm dilated (lol üò™)

1045pm: Foley balloon success! Wowww it was uncomfortable. Did my best to stay relaxed. But she got it in the first try. Very crampy right afterwards‚Ä¶ but got a little better 10 min later. 

1115pm: Contractions at this point were getting very painful.

Sometime from 11-12am: Took fentanyl. Worked wonders. Super interesting feeling like oh you know you‚Äôre on drugs. Wore off a little bit before the hour hit though :(

130am: They gave me morphine to sleep. Stopped pain completely, it was MAGICAL. Although, I was super dizzy all the way until 9am. I also didn‚Äôt sleep the entire time. Definitely felt like I was on drugs though lol

930am: First time throwing up from the dizziness.

945am: Because I threw up, they gave me nausea medication and also started pitocin. Midwife said we will just keep the foley balloon in there until it falls off. 

10am: Because I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep (maybe 1.5 hours at 7am‚Ä¶.), I‚Äôm still super super sleepy. FYI I thought I‚Äôd be going through all of these poses, being in hot showers‚Ä¶ but no. I‚Äôm literally just laying in bed the entire time. It just felt the most comfortable as I was constantly drifting to sleep (or attempting to). 

1022am, 11am, 1137am, 1210pm, 1230pm, 120pm, 145pm: Increased pitocin. I literally didn‚Äôt feel contractions/pain this entire time.

255pm: Midwife decided to check the balloon because she thought it was already out‚Ä¶ and it was! And then she said I was dilated 5cm! She offered to break my water, but I asked for an epidural. Since the balloon was out, she said that I will probably start feeling contractions now with the pitocin and can wait and see if I can handle without epidural first.
She also said I had a high pain tolerance when she checked I was at 5cm. That part was reallyy uncomfortable. Lol.

314pm: Definitely feeling the contractions now, but still manageable. It also radiates to the back. 

406pm: Contractions almost getting to the point as last night. On fentanyl again. Thaaaaank the lord for drugs.

5pm: Got an epidural at this point. Because that location‚Äôs L&amp;D was fairly empty, I got it within 10 min of asking. Injection didn‚Äôt hurt at all

8pm: Midwife checked‚Ä¶ and I was 9.5cm! 

9pm: Just waiting on the team to get ready and probably for me to dilate the rest .5cm.

945pm: Still no team. I guess they‚Äôre waiting for me to labor down. What a damn long ass wait Jesus. Around this time, they checked and said I had a high temp and baby would as well. As a precaution, I took antibiotic and waited a little more. 

1015pm:  Started pushing with a midwife and nurse. 

2am: Kept pushing but still didn‚Äôt progress as much as they would‚Äôve liked. 

3am: Midwife said that if I don‚Äôt progress, she is going to ask the doctor to come in about the vacuum. She said after three attempts if baby isn‚Äôt out, I would need c section. They also brought in a mirror for me which was helpful. 

315am: I was so determined not to have either vacuum or c section that I pushed at 200% level from 3-312am. Baby Gemma was here at 1:32am!

Overall it started out slow and not great but I think it got much better and now I‚Äôm a momma to the cuuutest little girl üò≠

Some thoughts:

- if your hospital was like mine, they have slow WiFi. Would recommend downloading Netflix shows ahead of time.
- epidural: I was shaking uncontrollably. I was unaware that was a side effect. I eventually stopped, but then started shaking again later. Midwife said it was because I was in the transitional phase and common.
- husband and I were both fine with our bed situations, but we brought a blanket just in case. That helped during my shaking period.
- i originally didn‚Äôt want to see my situation down there with a mirror. But because of the epidural, it was hard to pinpoint exactly where I needed to push. I thought it helped tremendously.
- Ask your support person to help hold one of your leg during pushing. It is tiiiring. My arms were sore days after.
- postpartum is no joke. It is painful af. The nurses do a good job in helping, but make sure you have a support person at home to help you.",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,92519,public,self,Negative turned positive graduation and some thoughts,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/p2jvig/negative_turned_positive_graduation_and_some/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me start by saying this is will be my second baby in a covid unfriendly environment. My son was born last year and during my whole pregnancy it was all lock downs, fear and paranoia all the while being an essential worker. Also this is probably going to be a long one.

What I‚Äôm about to rant is probably going to trigger some and I will probably get a lot of negative comments. All I‚Äôm asking for is for someone just to acknowledge what I‚Äôm saying and maybe provide some sort of unbiased feed back. 

Ok here goes‚Ä¶we are older parents (36F) and (45M) didn‚Äôt think it would ever happen especially after close to 10 years together and then lo and behold I get pregnant in December of 2019 and pop out our son in September of 2020. We agreed we want him to have a sibling. So we started ‚Äútrying‚Äù a few months ago and here we are I missed my period and have taken 3 tests and all positive. I‚Äôm not far along at all I had a period in July so a few weeks at best. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic as I‚Äôve miscarried before so I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes too far up. I haven‚Äôt told hubs and don‚Äôt plan on it for at least a few weeks. Ok now that we have a little back story let‚Äôs move on to the rest of why I‚Äôm posting.

I have high blood pressure, it runs in the family, my first pregnancy went fine. My OBGYN and midwife were amazing and took great care of me through out my entire pregnancy. Prior to getting pregnant I was searching for a new doc for general care but once I got pregnant the OBGYN took over and made sure I stayed on my meds right? Well once baby came and no longer needed the OBGYN I was faced with searching for a new doc. I found one that was local to me go to see him for my first appointment. He comes in quickly speaks fast tells me what I need to do to lower my bp says I need to bring my baby to him (we already had a pediatric doc by then) so he can care for him and then pretty much dismissed me. I had tried to explain to him my prior and current health concerns but I felt like it fell on deaf ears. I leave annoyed and tell myself I will find another doctor. I did and ended up sick with a cold. I go to my appointment with new doc and they won‚Äôt see me without a negative covid test. I knew it was a cold no need for a test. I‚Äôm annoyed and out of meds and have no choice but to see bad doctor again. I see him we go over my care he gives me my RX and I‚Äôm on my way. Now the third time I have to see him I‚Äôm hopeful that maybe I just read him wrong and he isn‚Äôt that bad. (Disclaimer: Here is where I‚Äôm expecting backlash from whom ever reads this) We go over the usual info and he tells me my bp is a higher than normal and is increasing my meds. Ok cool. Then he asks me if I‚Äôve been vaccinated yet to which I reply no. He says why not? I give him my reasons and then he tries to express to me why I should get vaccinated. Tells me he is a doctor and he cannot be wrong and I‚Äôm misinformed. All I can do is smile and say let‚Äôs just agree to disagree. I‚Äôve been to see him twice more and this last time he and I had a blow up as he was seeing me out. He again asked if I was vaxed I said no and I don‚Äôt plan on it either and I would kindly not talk about this again. He tells me I‚Äôm irresponsible, misinformed, just chastised me in front of his staff and another patient. It wasn‚Äôt a yelling match I stayed as calm as I could but I was seething to say the least. I plan on reporting him to the medical board and the local medical boards as well for his lack of professionalism. 

Now about the covid vaccine‚Ä¶I am not an anti vax person at all. My son is vaccinated but we did choose a delayed schedule but vaccinated nonetheless. I don‚Äôt not believe in vaccinations but this current vaccine for covid is not something I can be on board with. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable putting something in my body that is not FDA approved and the clinical research for adverse affects are being done as we speak on ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel like I should be bullied into something I don‚Äôt believe in. To get or not to get should be my choice dang it.

I have no one to talk to about this because In my experience you are either staunchly for the vaccine or staunchly against it. This whole ordeal has put so many doubts and dilemmas in my head about bringing another baby into this uncertain world.

I feel like hubby is more worried about how all this baby stuff will impact HIM and HIS life. But the one who's carrying the baby? Whatever, lol. 
As long as he gets what he wants, who cares?

Also, there's just as many worries for boys as there are for girls. To dismiss or say one has less purely because of gender is so fucking ignorant and downright dismissive ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I was so worried despite my obgyn and MFM both being very supportive and encouraging of my going (I've had a healthy/relatively symptom-free pregnancy thus far). 

TLDR: if you want to travel in the 3rd trimester and your obgyn okays/supports it, just go for it and don't stress unnecessarily! Compression socks and a bigger seat are totally worth it. Expect for the jetlag/travel tiredness to take a few extra days to get over. Look up where the closest hospital with obgyn services is for just in case.

Story: I flew by myself from the US to Europe at 32w and back at 34w. Both legs of the trip had a layover so 2 flights total, with the long flight being around 8.5-9.5 hours (slightly longer on the way back). I also did a 1.5hr shuttle on both legs of the trip to get from home to the airport and back. I did splurge for a larger seat on the long flight, which ended up being between comfort+ and first/business class. That, coupled with me being able to choose an aisle seat and a bulkhead/front row seat (so no one was in front of me), was so incredibly worth it! I was torn between a bigger seat and a direct flight and I'm so glad I went with the bigger seat. I wore compression socks as recommended by my doctors (20-30mmhg compression, I got these from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081655TVV/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I wore these for the entire trip, mostly because I struggled a bit getting them on and off so it was just easier to not have to do that in the airport/on the plane. They were very comfortable and I had minimal to no swelling in my legs. I drank a ton of water, they passed out water bottles and on my occasional walks around the plane I would go ask for/pick up another bottle. I also had a lot of my own snacks/sandwiches in case I didn't like the food on the plane (I ate pretty much everything I brought). I didn't get nauseous at all (I don't normally but had heard that pregnancy can sometimes cause this). I also had looked up the closest hospital with labor and delivery/obgyn services to where I was staying ahead of time at my doctor's recommendation, for just in case. I will say, the only thing I really noticed was especially with the trip back to the US, which I normally find more difficult anyway, I was totally exhausted. That plus the jet lag (7hrs time difference) it took me a few extra days to get over it all and feel back to normal, probably about a week before I felt 100% again. 

I was also really nervous about COVID-19 (I‚Äôm fully vaccinated) but found that the flight attendants were super on top of everyone wearing their masks properly so that helped ease my concerns. I did wear an N95 mask for the entire trip (I tried to eat/drink relatively quickly), I wore a mask while in stores/busy areas, and got tested before, during (within 3 days of return travel as required by the US with a home test), and after my trip.

Overall I'm so incredibly glad I made the trip and didn't let pregnancy concerns stop me! I should note that this was not a tourism trip so I wasn't on my feet all day exploring new places where bathrooms and food etc were unknown. The trip was to see family, but we did end up doing a lot of walking/biking so I definitely wasn't just sitting around the whole time.

I went to the Emergency Room and waited for 7 hours because I don't have a family doctor yet (we've already been on a wait list for 10 months, but that's another story). 

The doctor did an ultrasound and the baby was fine, had a strong heart beat and was in the right place in the uterus.

Currently 18w5d. Food aversion has been going on since week 6, to varying degrees. It was super intense in the beginning, but now I've found I'm able to eat more things but... Still quite limited on what I can actually bring myself to eat. And unfortunately, that equates to 99% junk food. 

Prior to pregnancy, I cooked on average 6-7 days a week. Maybe once every week or two, we'd get fast food or have an 'easy' freezer meal. But I usually cooked. Healthy food too, typically, with lots of veggies. Upon finding out I was pregnant, I amped up the healthy food meal plan, replaced snacks with healthier alternatives like carrots and hummus, and just wanted to go full out on healthy eating with this pregnancy. This was all well and good until I hit week 6. I pulled out some leftovers to heat up and instantly I was going to vomit just from the sight of it. 

Fast forward to week 18, and I'm able to eat more options... But I cannot bring myself to cook anything. I will throw up just THINKING about raw meat, much less handling it or looking at it. And vegetarian options are tough as well because most veggies sound horrible to me right now. Plus the process of cooking + the SMELL of cooking makes me so sick. Literally the only thing I WANT to eat is fast food, and if I don't have that, I'll settle for a microwave meal. My husband doesn't have experience in cooking, but he also works 40+ hours while I'm currently unemployed, so I don't want to make him cook either. 

Idk, I just feel like a different person because of it? I'm normally kind of avidly against the constant consumption of fast food, and I generally enjoy cooking and vastly prefer a home cooked meal... But now it feels like my brain has been re-wired, and all I want is chicken strips or chicken nuggets, or something fried. Actually it's not even a matter of WANTING, it's a matter of tolerating. Of it being the only few things that don't make me want to hurl even at the thought of it.

Also with all this fast food and junk I've been eating, you'd think I'd be gaining a bunch of extra weight... Nope. I've actually have only lost weight until now. Although thankfully, I am no longer losing weight since reaching my second trimester, but I haven't been gaining anything either. Food is just the most stressful thing for me right now, to the point where I'd rather not eat than deal with figuring it out... Which, obviously, is not a good for baby.

Does anyone else have issues breathing especially when laying down? 
Every time I have to change positions it feels like I'm running a marathon... 
I'm so tired. I just want a few more decent nights of sleep before my baby boy gets here. 
Honestly I cannot wait for him to be here so I can have my body back. I feel like at this point I will have better luck sleeping during the newborn faze than this 3rd trimester...

So I was really looking forward to it! 

I will be 12 weeks and will tell my family for the first time as well. 

Well this week I started to shop around to book a spa and I discovered that none of them want to massage a pregnant woman in her first trimester.

When asked why, either there is no reasons mentionned but one did mention:  'some pressure points can cause abortion' like wtf? 
Sweetie if it was the really the case, our grandma's would not have aborted with coat hanger and put their life at risk with an infection if a massage could do the trick.

I did some research and it  looks like there is absolutely no scientific evidence linking massage to miscarriage, niet, nada and actually tons to prove benefits of massage, so why do they still have this outdated policy? 
And another reason why they do not I read in the US is because of the high risk of miscarriage on 1st trimester and they don't want to wonder if it could be the massage. 
Being on this subs for 2 months now I thought it was established by now the vast majority or early miscarriage happen beyond our control. 

Unfortunately I think another big reason behind this thinking are all the pseudo science linked to massage with energies which are not scientifically proven as well and i feel so frustrated they deny me a massage because of some bullshit they were told. 

Thinking of going w/o telling I am pregnant I can still pretend I have a bloat

Is it the same in your countries? Or did I miss a renowned study showing a link?

I will preface what I‚Äôm about to say by saying that I have contacted my EAP and am setting up counselling sessions to deal with this, as I understand on some level my reaction is not normal or healthy. I am also not suicidal or having thoughts of self harm.

I am anxious, despondent and hopeless about the future for myself and my baby. I don‚Äôt know if 10 weeks is when a new batch of hormones kicks in and maybe that is what is contributing to this, as in the past I have heard news about climate change and have been concerned but able to cope and go on about my day. I didn‚Äôt even read the articles because as soon as I saw the headlines I immediately fell into a depression and knew that reading further would make things worse. I saw enough to get the gist. I got through my workday (WFH) on Monday distracting myself enough but was pretty low in the evening. I woke up yesterday morning after having nightmares all night and was completely unable to muster the motivation to work so I called in sick. I called my EAP Provider and got the name of a counselor and am waiting for a call back. I spent the rest of the day trying to distract myself binge watching TV, but these thoughts keep creeping in. Even the screen saver on my TV, a beautiful picture of somewhere warm and sunny, triggers me and I start crying. I want this baby desperately but am scared for their future and the world we will be living in. I am scared my baby will not even live to be my age (34). The thoughts are intrusive and creeping into everything I do/think about. I haven‚Äôt told my husband because I don‚Äôt want him to worry as well, but I did tell my mom. She said that there is always a catastrophe on the horizon (noting she grew up during the Cold War scare) and we can‚Äôt predict the future, but my worry is that they have actually predicted it and it is grim. Effectively by the end of this decade, humanity could be permanently screwed. I just do not know or understand how to feel happy about a future that may not even exist. I am trying to work today but instead am at my desk sobbing as I write this. I know this is not normal or healthy for me or the baby, but at the same time I think that maybe being alarmed is normal and if more people were alarmed over this then maybe the planet would not be in the shape it is in. 

Anyways, id like to ask how others are coping and if there is any hope to be found that I can hang on to. Is there a chance that my hormones are making this worse and maybe things will level off and I can go back to feeling happy and excited ?

(UK) 

This my first pregnancy. The doctor reckons I'm 8 weeks, I don't think this is right but I have my first scan early September which I hope will confirm.

Anyway. Due to the issues in the world I had to leave the best job of my life, and join my current job in January. Started ok, but the amount of micromanaging and nitpicking that has been building up has left me in tears daily. Literally any task I do, my manager will find something I've done wrong, or some way I could've done it better. If I take initiative and do something, I get told off. If I wait to be told to do it, I get told off. Damned if I do and damned if I don't. They extended my probation due to lack of attention to detail, so I might be fired in a few months. 

The past few months I've been job searching but with very little luck. I've updated my CV, and applied for jobs that are about ¬£10k less than what I'm earning, just to get somewhere with less stress. Of the thousands of jobs I've applied for, I have had two interviews. One I cancelled as the interview was two days after I found out I was pregnant, and I decided I didn't want to give up my weekends off and work retail, pregnant in a pandemic. The second interview was yesterday and while it was less pay, I will take it if they offer.

So my director from the job I left said he'd need me back in a few months. I said great, yes please, perfect. And then I found out I was pregnant. Yesterday I explained to him that yes I do still want to come back, but it's only fair to let you know that I'll be on leave in the spring. He said he'd talk to his business partner about it and wished me luck with the interview and baby. So yeah, not sounding too positive.

In my country it's discrimination to not hire someone because they're pregnant, but if I'm rejected they could just give a different reason. I'm not showing yet so I'm not too worried about potential employers finding out and rejecting me, but obviously eventually I will be showing. Let's face it, who would hire a pregnant woman if they're just gonna go on leave, resulting in the company paying two people?

And the payments. My god, it's like we're punished for wanting a family. Maternity pay or allowance is ¬£151 a week before tax. I'm lucky my fiancee earns a decent amount but jeez, might as well not give me any money at all. I knew about the financial side long before we starting trying, I just needed to vent. 

I also told my current employer because I'm going to be needing time off for appointments. My manager said she overheard me on the phone saying I'm waiting to hear from the hospital, and that she needed to know what for, if it was going to affect the office, and she also said she wanted to know if I was OK. I told her and she says oh I thought it'd be something more serious. 

I'm stuck. This baby was planned but I'm freaking out. I've got a great support system at home but work makes me so stressed I worry it'll cause harm to the baby. But last time I told my manager I was struggling with a task, she said I shouldn't be because it's my job. So how would I tell them I'm worried about being stressed??? My anxiety is sky high, causing stomach pain and i am close to tears on the bus every morning. I'm just hoping I find something soon.

A while back I found out I am pregnant (now 31 weeks) and my mom decided she wanted to convert that upstairs area into a proper bedroom with a bathroom.

She decided to get an architect to draw it up and we were going to add a domer to make it larger. The architect took 4 months to get the plans back! They are great but now I have like 9 weeks left in my pregnancy. 

My issue is we are in August and my mom doesn‚Äôt want to start construction until October because of financial bullshit. 

The plans mean that we have to add support for the new upstairs on every level of the house so it‚Äôs a total renovation!! 

Construction and new born babies do not really mix. My question is what do I do now? Do we move out for construction? Do I stay and hope for the best? How can the baby sleep through construction? Do I try to pool money and fully move which means  scraping the idea all together? Please any idea or new line of thought would be great!!

So I have to come here to vent/rant because I know I won‚Äôt receive abuse at the very least (can‚Äôt wait to share ive given birth or babies sex, happy things haha): 

I‚Äôve been honest with my therapist about my life, deemed competent and absolutely fine to be taking care of my child and was assured my child would not be used to override any of my confidentiality UNLESS I was in very direct danger (I am not, any perceived danger is not near me). So I use therapy more or less to bitch about my life and try to be honest about how I feel and to better myself for my child! 

Anyway, they lied and they are planning on formalising my safeguarding that I‚Äôve been upset about because well, I have a personality disorder and I can see how I may be deemed as not competent for the additional things that are making my pregnancy harder, because by formalising they mean getting child services involved. I‚Äôm really annoyed about this as I‚Äôve been safeguarded but now apparently they‚Äôre not happy until it is formalised. My therapist stated she wasn‚Äôt going to lie and can see why I have apprehensions towards social services but she also won‚Äôt demonise them (which I understand). 

Anyway, I went to sought support/rant on a group more geared towards my disorder and somebody private messaged me under the guise of being able to say something helpful, only to then say (I am not condensing the main points in here) 

‚ÄòI have a mother with bpd, she ruined my life, if you care about your child you will abort them immediately or adopt them out to a normal family. You‚Äôre a single mother with bpd, both of which will mess up your child and give them bpd‚Äô

I apologised to them for their shitty childhood but told them projecting their mothers downfalls on me isn‚Äôt appropriate, because I‚Äôm not their mum. They proceeded to basically say I‚Äôm using my kid as a gap filler and they‚Äôre not an extension of me (which I know because even in the womb they‚Äôre much greater than me) and basically I‚Äôm shit and don‚Äôt care. I know it is only the internet, but this worries me because it only takes one social worker to covertly think like this to make my life hard. My cousin is a social worker (a great one at that) but has agreed that subjective opinions of social workers can be linked to the objectivity of the books if they try hard enough. 

I am going to continue my therapy but I will only vent about the separate treatment I receive because my trust is gone.

I'm not a FTM but my first was 9 years ago, so I feel like everything is new again.

Me and my partner had planned a home birth, we had it all prepared - pool, towels, pumps ... everything. Baby was due the 6th of August and we were so excited.

So on the 3rd I had a day of back pain, I rang the midwives and was assured that this was probably false labour, there were no regular contractions and the pains came and went throughout the day. She even came and examined me about 11pm, no dilation just pains. I'd had this a couple times the week previous so just carried on and went to bed.

At exactly 11:58pm that night my waters broke, we rang the homebirth team who said that normally they like the baby to come within 24 hours of the waters breaking. I explained I was now feeling a bit of pain and they suggested I head to the hospital (15 minute drive) to get some morphine and then head home and set up the home birth. It was all very calm.

We left at 12:15 and arrived at the hospital at 12:30. I was in the most pain I'd ever been in, having minutely contractions and struggling to walk and sit.  I was panicking as far as I was aware this was still early labour, I had no idea how I was going to manage the pain getting worse. I was examined at 12:40ish and was 8cm and ready to push. She arrived at 1.02am! It was the most stressful and rushed half an hour of my life. But she was safe and healthy. I only got gas and air for the last 5 minutes and by then it was pretty pointless üò¨

Obviously being the unorganised and naive parents we are we had packed no hospital things as we were convinced we wouldn't be staying! So me and baby spent the next 3 hours naked on a hospital bed whilst my partner organised the logistics of child care for my eldest and getting supplies to the hospital, including a car chair. 

We left the hospital at 5:30am and headed home with our beautiful girl! She's the most amazing baby. And everything has been bliss since üòä (interesting extra, she had a true knot in her cord, which is suppose to indicate good luck).

I found out this last Friday, and called my doctor first thing on Monday, so I managed to get an early prenatal and ultrasound scheduled for the 20th.

And I know it‚Äôs probably nothing personal or anything, and I‚Äôm sure once I get this story out I‚Äôll feel better. But my step sister Amanda is pregnant and I‚Äôm feeling a little hurt and left out. I mainly just wanted to get some insight on why she might be doing some of these things. I don‚Äôt want to bother her with this so I really hope this pregnant sub can help me understand what she might be going through. I just want to be there for her and not feel butt hurt. 

My step-sister Amanda and I are pretty close. We are the same age (F 28) and growing up we would live with each other 2 weeks out of the month while I moved back and forth from my mom‚Äôs house/dad‚Äôs house. Met when we were 4-5 and have just been practically the best of friends since. 

We were both each other‚Äôs maids of honours at our weddings, and go to each other for practically everything. Told each other about first kisses, first period, first boyfriend etc‚Ä¶
We even both bought a house just one street over so we see each other a lot and it‚Äôs been going well. 

A few months ago it was her birthday, and we all went to her house where her husband BBQ‚Äôd and we all had a good time. When it was time for the cake a friend of hers came out holding a cake with an ultrasound photo on it that said ‚ÄúBaby due October‚Äù

Anyways we were all pretty shocked but super excited, this meant she was about 4 months along. We hugged her and celebrated, it was a huge surprise to everyone except a friend of hers that was there. He had told me later on after we were cleaning up that she had told him the moment she missed her period. 
 
When I heard this I was a little shocked, and I‚Äôll admit hurt, that her friend Alec knew this information before me. Mostly it surprised me because: 

About 10 months prior she was late for her period and called me up on the phone, telling me she was about to do a pregnancy test. While we waited, we chatted excitedly as she told me some baby names she liked, and she had said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be the godmother right?‚Äù
I told her of course I would! Turns out it was negative though, which was fine because this was before they had the room for a baby. (She and her husband lived with his mom for a bit) So I thought it was a little surprising she told Alec right away this time and not me like before. 

It was also a huge shock to me she never told me anything after 4 months. It was hard to tell she was pregnant because she always wears big flowy bohemian dresses/cardigans so I never noticed a bump or anything obvious. But I shrugged it off and told her congratulations and we caught up on some of the stuff I missed out on and the next day we made plans for the nursery. All was good. 

Fast forward to now. She was going to do a gender reveal party, so she had the info in this little envelope that she gave to mom for safe keeping and the weeks leading up to finding out the gender we were both excitedly counting down. Guessing if it‚Äôs a boy or a girl. Texting me baby name ideas, party ideas etc. I suggested making the cake for her to cut into to see the colour and she said yes and was sending me decoration ideas. 

Well suddenly outta the blue she calls me and says she couldn‚Äôt wait till next week to find out so she got the envelope back and found out the gender. I was surprised she didn‚Äôt wanna wait and asked her what she was having. She said she decided her and her hubby and mom were all going to keep it a secret till the birth so she wants to cancel the party. I was pretty disappointed, as I was looking forward to knowing what it was‚Ä¶but invited her and her husband for dinner to celebrate anyways just us 4. 

So tonight they came over and as we were talking Amanda said ‚ÄúWe found the name for our baby! It‚Äôs sooo perfect! I really wish I could tell you!!‚Äù
I was excited and started asking for a hint - is it old fashioned? Unique? Starts with an A? (Her name is Amanda, her husband‚Äôs name is Aaron. So they debated on a few A names) 
But she wouldn‚Äôt tell me so eventually we kinda dropped it but throughout the night she kept saying things like ‚ÄúMan! If onlyyy I could tell you!‚Äù
So of course I would press and she would say ‚ÄúNo no because you can‚Äôt know the gender.‚Äù 

Anyways, near the very end, Aaron and my husband were talking about how my husband‚Äôs godfather is like a second father to him so to choose wisely because it‚Äôs pretty important. Aaron said he was choosing his cousin for the godfather and then that‚Äôs when Amanda says ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt decided on a godmother yet‚Äù

Sooo at this point my heart deflated. Because I know for a fact a few months prior she told me I would be the godmother. 

Just to clarify: I understand this is Amanda‚Äôs baby, and Amanda‚Äôs pregnancy journey. She doesn‚Äôt have to tell me anything she doesn‚Äôt want to. And this is about her, Aaron and her little baby. But‚Ä¶I still can‚Äôt help but feel almost a little hurt and confused. I‚Äôm not sure why things are different this time around. She hasn‚Äôt acted different towards me, we still talk everyday and see each other constantly. 

I‚Äôve never been pregnant and can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want kids so I really really cannot relate to what she might be going through. I‚Äôm hoping maybe some of you can give me insight? Maybe you have been through something similar before? I know I shouldn‚Äôt take it personally. Just wanted it off my chest. And maybe get some insight.

### Choosing an OB-GYN for pregnancy care: Who they are, what they do, and when you should see one

If you've never had children ‚Äì or even if you have ‚Äì you'll quickly understand that pregnancy comes with a lot of options.  
Some decisions are minor, such as selecting a cot or clothing. Other decisions are more significant, such as deciding on a daycare centre and picking the appropriate name. However, one of the most important decisions you'll make is who you'll see for prenatal care.  
From your first prenatal appointment to the first few weeks after your baby is born, the person you entrust with your care will be there for you. While midwives are a viable choice for pregnancy care, many women prefer to see an OB-GYN doctor.  
Don't worry if you don't know what an OB-GYN is. We'll go over that later. We also provide information on what an OB-GYN does throughout pregnancy and what you can expect during the birthing process. We also have information that will help you decide whether or not an OB-GYN is best for you for pregnancy care.

### What does OB-GYN means?

An OB-GYN (obstetrician-gynecologist-gynecologist-gynecologist-gynecologist-gynecologist-gy But, more specifically, an OB-GYN (obstetrician-gynecologist) is a medical specialist who specialises in female reproductive health.  
Well visits (also known as annual exams), sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, breast exams, heavy periods, birth control, and any other gynecologic concern can all be handled by OB-GYNs.  
When it comes to prenatal treatment, the ""OB"" portion of the name comes into play.  
Obstetrics is a department of medicine dedicated to assisting women with guided therapies during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. OB-GYNs are specialists on everything that is routine and everything that isn't when you're expecting. Obstetricians and gynecologists' also deliver infants, both vaginally and through Cesarean section (C-section).

### So, what distinguishes an OB-GYN from an obstetrician or a gynecologists'?

Obstetricians only treat pregnant women and those who have recently given birth. Gynecologists, on the other hand, concentrate on the reproductive health of women as a whole. An OB-GYN, on the other hand, is trained in both obstetrics and genecology, however some doctors prefer to specialize on one.

### What about nurse-midwives who are certified? What's the difference between the two?

Both OB-GYNs and certified nurse-midwives have extensive training, licencing, and experience in pregnancy and childbirth. However, there are a few differences between these two experts.  
One of the most significant distinctions between OB-GYNs and midwives is their birthing specialties: OB-GYNs can care for women who are pregnant with high-risk pregnancies, but midwives are better suited to low-risk pregnancies and women who desire no-to-low intervention deliveries.

### During pregnancy, what does an OB-GYN do?

When you choose an OB-GYN to care for you during your pregnancy, they will focus on your complete health. They use the most up-to-date evidence-based medicine, as well as their own personal experience, to provide individualized treatment for each stage of pregnancy.  
Furthermore, OB-GYNs are well-versed in the complexities of pregnancy and delivery. They're well-equipped to handle your care in any situation.

### What to expect on delivery day if you're having a baby with an OB-GYN

Your baby will be born at a hospital or a hospital-based birth center. Your doctor will lead your care team, which will include nurses and, if necessary, other specialists. While your OB-GYN will deliver your baby, they will normally rely on their care team to monitor your labor and notify them when the big day arrives.  
Your OB-GYN will also go over your options for using common birth interventions to help with labor and delivery. They'll tell you what to expect whether you opt for an epidural¬† or an induced birth, for example. If issues arise, they can also conduct unexpected or emergency C-sections and other treatments.  
The type of setting you can expect will be determined by the facility you choose. Our birth centres were all created with you in mind. We want to make sure you have the birthing experience you want, and your OB-GYN and the rest of your care team can help.

### What to expect from postpartum care with an OB-GYN while you recover from childbirth

You're undoubtedly aware that your baby's check-up routine will be hectic during the first year or so of his or her life. However, your health is crucial, particularly in the first several months after giving birth. Postpartum check-ups can help with this.  
Your OB-GYN will want to see you within six weeks of giving birth to make sure you're doing well. Following that, you'll consult with your OB-GYN to see if you need any extra follow-up visits in the coming weeks.

### Is an OB-GYN your best option for prenatal care?

It's a major decision to trust someone with your pregnancy and child's delivery. If you're looking for a doctor that specialises in women's health, an OB-GYN might be the best option for you.

* You have a medical condition that has to be addressed (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, depression and more)
* You're having a difficult pregnancy.
* You want a doctor who is well-versed in medical and surgical interventions that may be required during labour and delivery.

### How do you pick an OB-GYN for your pregnancy?

Who you choose depends on what you're looking for in a doctor, from location to experience to a personality match. Whether you go with an OB-GYN or a midwife, you'll be working with a trained expert who is committed to providing you with the best care possible. It's simply a matter of finding the right match for you.

C section is Scheduled October 8 for our baby girl, yay!

Well I've noticed that this pregnancy was a lot harder than my last (I didn't enjoy either pregnancies though. Genuine misery), but not too too bad just more or more extreme annoyances:


First pregnancy:

Sciatica that comes and goes 

Pelvic bone pain

Nausea first trimester

Slightly less energy than normal

Severe hunger pains

Anemia

Heart burn the last month



Second pregnancy:
Sciatic that lasts the entire day

SEVERE pelvic bone pain to the point if I as much as roll over in bed I'll be CRYING in pain. Getting off the couch? Pain. Lying in the floor with my toddler? Pain.

Severe nausea entire pregnancy

Tired 24/7 no matter how much rest I get. I could sleep 10 hours at night and still be falling asleep on the couch or floor

Anemia

Asthma

Complete disinterest in anything sexual most of the time

Severe heart burn/acid reflux (started at 23 weeks) that if I as much as stand up too fast I'll throw up burning stomach acid right then and there with no control

Almost no control over bladder (literally will just ""leak"" pee sometimes and I'll have to excuse myself to the bathroom - I keep spare underwear with me)

New allergy to, get this, my husbands semen!

Lack of hunger

Throbbing migraines

Restless leg syndrome at night



But the worst of it all is that I'm in such awful pain if I as much as bend over (extreme pressure from chest all the way to pelvic bone, acid reflux hits with nausea, out of breath immediately and just all around hurts like someone is clamping my intestines and ribs with a vice) to pick up my son's toys that I choose to get on the floor and crawl or scoot around on my butt, instead.

My doctor said the second pregnancy is usually harder and everything seems fine despite certain complications, but come on dude!

I know this sounds silly but it‚Äôs pretty awful. So I literally just got home after a trip to the ER where I got seen for dehydration from a stomach bug/virus I‚Äôve had for a couple days. 

I went alone since my husband was still at work and didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd be there for 5 hours. The nurse who put my IV in (the side of my wrist, too) didn‚Äôt have the lab tubes ready that collect the blood, and she also forgot to take off the tourniquet so I was literally pouring blood from my arm while she frantically looked for the tubes. It was really bad. To make it worse, I was also simultaneously puking into a sick bag while watching the blood drench the sheets and pool on the floor. 

So anyway, I got discharged and went to Whataburger for some food because I was starving. I don‚Äôt care if I throw it up, I hadn‚Äôt eaten in hours. So Whataburger serves their little breakfast menu from 11pm-11am and it includes a delicious little number known as the honey butter chicken biscuit. It‚Äôs what it sounds like‚Äîfried chicken tender on a biscuit covered with honey butter. 

I pull up and order at 10:56 and asked if I could get breakfast and was told no. Okay, I get it, rules are rules and I‚Äôm not special. But then the guy comes out to my car to take payment for my fries and sprite and asks me ‚Äúwhat would you have ordered if you could get breakfast?‚Äù I told him and he gave me this look like ‚ÄúI got you‚Äù. He also asked how far along I am. I got so excited thinking omg he‚Äôs gonna make it happen for me!

So he comes back out and nonchalantly hands me my bag that just had fries in it like he didn‚Äôt just get my hopes up. Like why the hell would you ask me that only to do nothing?!

They paid $50 the day they left the hospital, and around $400 within the next 3 months. 

I will be in a new benefits year when I have the baby (US.) Thankfully, they bill for all visits and the 20 week ultrasound as part of the birth when baby is born. 

Downfall, is all other labs and fees for my first ultrasound will not count towards my out of pocket maximum which is $4,000 per year. We have to put down a $1500 deposit before the 28th week and owe the remaining part of my out of pocket maximum, $2,500, within 30 days of the birth.

I told my parents this tonight and they about fell over. Thankfully they are an amazing support system and will always help us out if we need it.

Basically I vomit every other day or so and have nausea almost all the time, but I have been able to work part time and do OK. 

We would be taking a 2 hour flight to my in-laws, staying for about a week, and another 2 hour flight back. We haven‚Äôt seen my in-laws in almost 2 years due to covid and I know my husband really wants to see them. My mother and father in law have a hard time traveling due to physical disabilities, so we try to see them at least 1 per year since we are much more mobile than they are. We truly don‚Äôt mind. Thankfully my in-laws are very nice and down to earth people. 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt want to go. I am so scared of puking in the airport or on the airplane. I am scared of puking at my laws and wetting myself (because that happens more often than I'd like to admit). I am scared of trying to go out to eat and not being able to stomach anything at a restaurant. But I know how much my husband misses his family and how much they want to see me and my cute lil baby bump. 

I‚Äôve expressed this worry to my husband and he is kinda quiet about it right now. That means he is thinking about it. I know he takes my worries into consideration and can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt force me to do anything. I can tell though that he is kinda hurt that I am not excited to go, but he also understands i‚Äôve been through hell and want to try and stay as comfortable as I can. I am tired of throwing up and feeling miserable. 

Should I just toughen up and go? It‚Äôs been so long since seeing everyone and my husband is really missing his family. 

Side note: I have told him he should go without me, but he didn‚Äôt want to go by himself. Not sure if its because he is worried about leaving me alone while still not 100% recovered from HG or if its because he knows his parents really want to see me too. 

Another note: Covid isn‚Äôt a big worry for us. All vaccinated and we all have been working from home (including my in-laws). We‚Äôve all been trying to quarantine ourselves before going. Yes there is always the risk at the airport and on the airplane, but we will be masked and all that fun stuff.

My brain gravitates towards the least invasive, most natural options available. I'm going to try to avoid C-section, induction, and epidural - though I will absolutely defer to the doctor and my body's needs in the moment. 

However, for the last five days, I have had crippling stomach pains at random times. These are not Braxton Hicks cramps nor are they contractions - they've been happening at random intervals and feel like the worst stomach flu I've ever had, but then they stop just as suddenly. Sometimes they're accompanied by diarrhea or nausea, but not always. They're so bad that I've had to take off work early, using all that precious leave time I've built up. On top of that, my back is killing me, I'm getting carpal tunnel, my right foot is a water balloon that doesn't fit into any shoes, and every joint in my body aches. 

Plus at 42+2, my spouse will be returning to nursing school, so his time getting to spend time with the baby dwindles every day I stay pregnant. 

So, with all that in mind, should I ask for a membrane sweep at my appointment tomorrow afternoon?

I went in to work today feeling kinda dizzy and unsteady, and just generally unwell. I let someone know immediately, in case it got worse or I needed to sit, since I‚Äôm a cashier. 

After being on my feet for about 45 minutes to an hour, I started to feel pain in my lower back and abdomen that felt like mild period cramps. I pushed through, kept working, and it only got worse the more I moved around and longer I stood, until it finally hit a peak about 2 1/2 hours into my shift. I felt like I might collapse from the pain. I let my manager know, and she sent me home. She even got me a ride so I wouldn‚Äôt have to walk.

Since I don‚Äôt have a doctor yet, I had no one to call or ask questions but my mom. She asked if the pain was constant or came and went, and a bunch of other questions. Told me if it didn‚Äôt stop I would need to go to the ER, which I was considering anyway. 

I have been laying down for the last 2 1/2 hours since I got home, and I feel a lot better, but if I sit up or stand the pain comes back. Baby is super active and kicking me, but my stomach is occasionally getting hard like Braxton Hicks. It only hurts if I‚Äôm sitting or standing, otherwise it‚Äôs just pressure.

Hope this is helpful for other people who might be researching their options! 

I decided to splurge on two items hoping that they would live up to Hatch's promise of being able to be worn throughout pregnancy and after. I ultimately decided on the [Visitor Dress](https://www.hatchcollection.com/collections/dresses/products/the-visitor-dress-maternity?variant=38145798439089?color=oat-melange) and the [Noelle Jumpsuit](https://www.hatchcollection.com/products/the-maternity-noelle-jumpsuit?color=black). I was surprised to find that Hatch charges additionally for shipping, especially considering the price points for their items. I opted for the $5 shipping option, which ended up taking 11 days to arrive (again, not terribly impressive given the price points).

The Visitor Dress is meant to be oversized (it only comes in a regular and petite version, so it is essentially one size fits all), and that much was obvious from the photos on the website. Unfortunately, the proportions were totally off ‚Äî¬†the top half was massive with pretty dramatic dolman sleeves, but the bottom taped to a very tight hemline that made it difficult to walk around in. I'm just over 16w so I don't have much of a bump at this point but am into the oversized look; still, the fact that it was so big above my bump vs. at my bump made it look a little odd. That said, the material was very soft and comfortable ‚Äî it reminded me of the material Athleta uses for some of their sweaters. However, this one will be going back.

The Noelle Jumpsuit is a linen button-down jumpsuit with a sash that can be removed. Unfortunately for me, though, Hatch left out the sash altogether! Again, very disappointed with this oversight, and I expect better quality control when I'm buying a $278 jumpsuit. Overall, the fit of the jumpsuit was fine, but there was very little give to the fabric (not surprising with linen) and seemingly nowhere near enough room for a third trimester-sized bump. The pants legs also hit at a very unflattering point for me (I'm 5'4""). Although I generally liked the look of it, I will be returning this one, as well, due to the combination of the missing sash and the fact that the material and fit just don't justify the price tag.

The online returns process was pretty straightforward. However, despite the fact that they didn't ship me a complete product (missing sash), they still charged me $10 for return shipping, which rubs me the wrong way. 

My takeaway: Hatch pitches themselves as a high-end maternity wear option but does not deliver on that, giving customers a lukewarm (at best) customer service experience and a just-okay product.

These are a few things I‚Äôve learned over the last few weeks!


-Babies are noisy sleepers. If they‚Äôre keeping you up with their coos and grunts and farts‚Ä¶ put them in that nursery you spent so long preparing! We were all waking up 4x when my guy was in his bedside bassinet. In his crib in his room? He wakes up once, so we only wake up once. Everyone is much happier.


-Get a baby swing. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy (mine is a $60 fisher price dealie), but it‚Äôs so nice to have a place where baby is safe and content while I cook/clean/bathe/figure out what the dog is whining about.


-Get more zippered sleepers than you think you‚Äôll need, and fewer of basically every other piece of clothing. (At least up to 3 months).


-If you have a baby boy, mare sure their penises are pointed straight down when diapering. I forgot this rule and quickly learned the hard way why it‚Äôs so important. (Pee. Pee everywhere.)


Now, for mom:


-Listen to your body. Pregnancy and childbirth are rough. If something doesn‚Äôt seem right, get it checked out. You aren‚Äôt bothering the doctors and nurses. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for.


-Take time to rest. You have the best reason ever to order a pizza, kick your feet up, and binge that reality show you‚Äôre embarrassed to admit you love. (Below Deck. It‚Äôs so bad/amazing.)


-It‚Äôs ok to not want visitors. It‚Äôs ok to not want people touching your baby. Ask people for some time. Set boundaries. You‚Äôre allowed.


-It‚Äôs ok to not breastfeed. It‚Äôs okay to not have any reason other than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to‚Äù. 


And last but not least, remember that if you‚Äôre worried that you‚Äôre fucking it all up, it‚Äôs a good sign that you‚Äôre actually rocking it. Bad parents don‚Äôt worry about being bad parents!


With that said, it‚Äôs time for me to say goodbye to this sub. Thank you all for keeping me sane the last 10 months.

Saw the MFM on Monday, who told me she's ""on the fence"" about having me hospitalized to monitor for preeclampsia. 

Prior to pregnancy, my BP consistently ran in the 120/80 range, which I thought was the norm. Ever since I became pregnant, the top number as been running in the 130s, so they classified me as having chronic hypertension. I had an episode right as I entered the second trimester where I had a headache for 3 days, and went to the pharmacy to check my BP; It was 153/92. It eventually came down and my OB gave me Fioricet for the headache, which finally went away. Ever since then, BP has been running in the 140s. 

Last week, the top number read 150 in the office. They asked me to monitor it at home for a week, and all week the top number was between 135-150. Bottom number between 72-92. They ran my blood and urine, which came back normal/close to the baselines we ran in May. 

This week, the urine is slightly elevated from last week. They put my on a BP med, and are still having me home monitor BP, with the condition that if the top number goes above 160, or the bottom number above 110, that I go straight to the hospital. Also watching for a headache that won't go away, change in vision, or upper right abdominal pain. But of course, they warned me the new BP med they put me on may cause a headache for the first couple of days. And although they want the med to lower my BP, it can simultaneously mask preeclampsia by artificially lowering the BP to where we don't catch it. 

I'm beyond frustrated. I don't know what else to do. I feel awful. The new med is giving me vertigo, making it hard to sit at my desk, even though I'm working from home. We were already looking to induce at 37 weeks due to baby being big. I presume if I go into the hospital now, I'll be there until they decide to deliver - up to 5 weeks. COVID is surging in the area, so I don't even know what that would look like, except I'd pretty much be isolated. I think they'd allow 1 visitor per patient per day. My husband works nights, so he needs to sleep during the day.  I don't have enough saved to take an extra month of unpaid leave for extra hospitalization. My job has agreed I could continue to work remotely from the hospital from my laptop if that happens, but I don't know if that makes it better or worse. 

On top of all that, I need to get my COVID vaccine next week, since I got TDAP last week. So I'll get to add that awfulness to my current awfulness. 

I'm seeing the MFM and the OB every week now until delivery, with blood, urine, and NST tests every week, so they're keeping a close eye on LO.

FTM, 26 weeks + 3 days. I've been suffering some vaginal/urinary discomfort and irritation along with feeling like I just can't empty my bladder enough when I do urinate (no relief, just a continuous urge to urinate.)

I did at at home test and it came positive for leukocytes in my urine, but no nitrates. Like any responsibility person, I went to my OB and had them do a test there along with a vaginal test. OB said my urine was fine but she was sending it out to the lab along with the vaginsl swab.

OB prescribed me an antibiotic (Macrobid) and antifungal (Diflucan tablets) while we wait for the lab results.

Now, I must admit this isn't my usual OB (It's a practice so I'm used to seeing 3 main practitioners besides this one, but the OB today was the only one available.) The first thing that made me nervous was that I was prescribed Diflucan rather than the usual Tezarol cream  I had been prescribed two other times previously during this pregnancy. So, I said, let me talk to my pharmacist before I take the prescription.

So, I'm now at the pharmacy counter, and as the technician is ringing me up, I ask to speak to the pharmacist as I have some questions. She said sure, but prompted me to pay first, to which I politely declined, and asked again to speak to the pharmacist. It appeared the pharmacist was busy on the phone, so the technician asked me what my concerns were, to which I answers that I wanted to make sure the medication was safe to take while I'm pregnant. Now I'm getting nervous because I can tell the technician is just itching to get my questions answered and get me out of line, but the pharmacist is busy. So the technician has a brief conversation with the pharmacist (who is still on the phone) and comes back and begins to counsel me about how the medication might be safe, but probably isn't (the package insert for the Diflucan says to completely avoid if you are pregnant or think you may become pregnant- but she sold it to me anyway.)

Now, I must say, that in NJ (USA) it is legally prohibited for pharmacy technicians to counsel patients (beyond, take with food, water, avoid sunlight etc.) So now I'm mad. I'm nervous that my doctor prescribed me Diflucan, I'm upset that the pharmacist couldn't be bothered to counsel me about some whether it was safe for my unborn son and I to be taking this drug, and I'm angry that I decided to just pay for the medication and leave. Before I left, I did ask the technician if she normally counseled patients on behalf of the pharmacist, to which she replied, oh I didn't counsel you, I just let you know what the pharmacist said.

I know what occurred today should not have happened, and I left the pharmacy feeling worse than when I went in.

(I threw theirs too.) This is my first - 29 weeks, a boy.

I am excited in a lot of ways for my baby shower (seeing family and friends after so long &amp; presents! - don't judge me!!), but also feeling very hormonal and anxious for a few reasons. (Luckily, I am feeling less nervous about COVID lately, because I am vaccinated now, know that the vast majority of the people I invited are vaccinated, and the invites ask for vaccinations or masks.)

1) The ""all eyes on me"" feeling. Logically, I know that everyone is there to support me, but I'm feeling super self-conscious about everyone staring at me and asking possibly awkward questions. I'm 34 and having a child very late compared to a lot of women from my area, especially for how long my husband and I have been married. I have health concerns (epilepsy and chronic migraine) that those closest to me understand, but as my therapist says - I don't owe anyone an explanation about my health.

2) On a related note - I am not cute rn. I so admire those women that get beautiful pregnancy photoshoots; I love my bump, because I know that my little guy is in there, but my fat thighs - not so much. I just can't help feeling that everyone there will be judging me based on how I look. Months ago, I bought a super cute pink floral dress that fits great with thoughts of maybe wearing it to my shower. Well now that we've confirmed its a boy, should I instead wear blue??? (What a stupid gender construct! I just look cute in pink, okay?) My cousin did say that the decorations are a lot of blue, so I would pop in photos in a pink dress. My BFF also said I should go with the pink.  I will make sure that my hair and makeup is cute, and I will get my nails done for sure. If any ladies give me flak, I guess I can just tell them to buzz off??

2) I'm worried that no one will come! I just texted my cousin to ask what RSVPs were looking like and it sounds like about a third of the invites have RSVPed ""yes."" Thank God... But what if no one else RSVPs? Its being held in a pretty big pavilion (which is great for COVID!), but I don't want it to look empty like no one wanted to come.

The contractions start becoming pretty painful around 12:30. They are intense enough that I asked my husband to grab the nurse so I can get the epidural before things really get intense. The nurse comes in and says the anesthesiologists will be up in about 15 minutes. In that short time I have maybe 4 more incredibly painful contractions. The anesthesiologists comes in, asks my husband to wait in the waiting room two halls down, and starts setting up. The nurse has me sit and the very next contraction I get an overwhelming feeling to push. I tell the nurse this and can tells she is extremely surprised. She checks my cervix and then I hear her say...‚Äùok! You need to call your husband back here now! You‚Äôre having this baby, no time for epidural!‚Äù The doctor rushes in the very next second followed by my husband who, thank god, made it back just in time.

I need someone else's take on my situation. 

This is my second pregnancy. I am not a good pregnant person. I get very sick and have ongoing issues that affect my health. During my first pregnancy, my husband was super husband. He took care of the house and me, we were in super bliss, and I talked shit on all the husbands who didn't do this for their wives (here comes that karma).

This time around has been so much harder. We have a toddler and again, i have been very sick. In the beginning, my husband spent his time chasing her around and I fended for myself which was expected. The house was a constant mess, and it was the most tense our marriage has ever been.

My husband is also someone who likes to ""do things himself."" We had a conversation about putting some house projects on hold, but he promised me he would do the bare minimum while I am pregnant and they wouldn't affect me.

As expected, shit blew up, my house is a wreck, my toddler is...a sweet, difficult toddler, and I am hormonal AF. My priority is to put my toddler first and not lose my shit, so I broke down to my husband the other day. I told him mentally, I need a break. We have been on the go every day, and I need one day to focus on me, my mental health, and nothing else.

He offered to take a day off. Today was that day. He told me he would take her somewhere, and I would have at least the morning to myself. I got to sleep in, and I woke up to my toddler yelling. Mom guilt and morning sickness crept in, so I headed downstairs to get breakfast and ran into an absolute mess. It immediately put me over the edge. I asked them to run errands for me to get some time. That time ended up with me cleaning my house, walking my dogs, and getting texts about spilled milk in the car. I guess that was my mental health morning. I am more anxious than I started. 

Is this something others are going through? I am having a really hard time being my best self.

This is my first ever pregnancy, I‚Äôm 5w5d. I think what‚Äôs surprised me the most is how much cramping I‚Äôve experienced! Before I took a test, I was 100% convinced my period was coming because the cramping was so bad. 

For context, I likely have endometriosis but have never been officially diagnosed since that requires surgery. I cramp a lot in my regular life, and had to go on the pill at age 14 to make it possible for me to function during my period. My menstrual cramping is always really bad, but I‚Äôll cramp at all points during the month, especially when I orgasm. I was really excited to be pregnant because I thought that would give me relief from cramping, but I guess not! My doctor has ruled out other issues, like PCOS and thyroid problems. 

I cramp pretty steadily during the day, but the night time is the worst right now. I wake up around 1am almost every night in bad pain that makes me nauseated. The pain usually corresponds with a bowel movement, and once that‚Äôs done it will subside a bit. Cramping is definitely my most annoying symptom, and triggers nausea. I have never had any spotting, not even the tiniest bit, but I‚Äôm always nervous that at any point I will start bleeding. I know not every pregnancy is viable and that this early on miscarriage is more of a possibility, but obviously that‚Äôs an undesirable outcome that‚Äôs making me nervous. 

When I look things up online, most sites say that cramping during this time should be light and mild, but I would say this approaches moderate territory to me. I don‚Äôt know if this is something that I should be concerned about. The cramping is not located more to one side than the other, so I don‚Äôt think this is a sign of an ectopic pregnancy or anything. 

Tl;dr what was your experience like with cramping in early pregnancy? Did you experience similar symptoms to me? Is this something I should be nervous about, or is it fairly common?

[Here's the link to the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/p0gi8i/i_need_advice_this_gets_heavy/)

I'm 18. I found out I was pregnant a few days ago, and went to see my doctor today. I asked for abortion and was immediately referred to a gynecologist where I found out I'm 20 weeks in my pregnancy! In Norway, asking for abortion after 12 weeks gestation requires a permission to be granted by the board. Then, depending on the situation, they grant or deny the request. Although, after 18 weeks, the stricter the rules become. Not saying that *that* influenced my decision. I was already in the middle of whether to keep the baby or not (as my last post have shown).

My final choice? I decided on keeping him/her. After a few days of whirlwind uncertainty, sized down to a gut feeling in the waiting room‚ÄîI was torn at the idea of abortion. After being indecisive for days, I made up my mind and discussed it with my boyfriend (21) who immediately went home to discuss it with his mom. 

Now, knowing that we have the support from both families, we're all really excited to welcome this new member into the family! I got so excited that I told my girlfriends who freaked out with me. One showed doubt, but was happy for me nonetheless. 

Any advice for a first time mom? I keep myself healthy with yoga; walks; fruits and vegetables with protein, fiber, and calcium; looots of water.

I‚Äôm usually on the tarot and esoteric side of reddit as I‚Äôm a professional reader, however I‚Äôve just recently joined pregnancy side of Reddit! 
I‚Äôm 9 weeks pregnant (baby due in March), and the amount of stress I‚Äôve gone through is through the roof. 
My parents gave me shit for it. The only people I can rely on are my fianc√© and his family. 
My parents cut contact with me because I refused to get married by force. 
My fianc√© proposed before I got pregnant, and we want to get married out of love. Not out of fear that my parents will never speak to me again because they‚Äôre ashamed of me having a baby before getting married. 
This in itself caused a lot of stress. 
My fianc√© is also a little distant (he laughed at the ultrasound, calls the baby ‚Äúlittle thing‚Äù, and just overall feels emotionally detached). I know I could be over sensitive due to hormones etc, but it‚Äôs really sad the way I can‚Äôt share things with my family and the person I do share them with is so emotionally distant. He didn‚Äôt want to have sex for a whole month after finding out we‚Äôre going to have a baby. This has all been too much for me. It caused me to take a months break from my tarot reading business which now that I‚Äôve opened up my shop again, I can see the effect me closing the shop had on my clients.

I've been carrying some feelings around with me for some time and am needing somewhere to dump them. Please be gentle on my hormonal, 24 week pregnant soul.

Our baby girl was planned and I've been pregnant since March. My husband since then hasn't has been excited as I thought he would of been. Actually, I feel that he has been pretty distant. He is glued to his phone when he wakes up in the morning and doesn't really engage. When he gets home at night he is on his phone playing games and then proceeds to go upstairs to play Fornite till late. I've been super tired this pregnancy which has caused me to go to bed early, so its what ever.

Never touches my bump.. He never intiates sex anymore which is a bummer since pregnancy which I've become very sexual and enjoy touch. I've always thought it was because he was exhausted from his job. But after stumbling across his history on YouTube, he has developed a late night routine of watching 20 years dressing up in sexy outfits. That hurt me since I try so hard to look good at 32 by taking good care of myself. I like the idea of getting some tweaks but he is so quick to dismiss them as ridiculous, yet he watches girls who have the done.

I'm an attractive, intelligent woman who has a lot to offer and it hurts me that he makes no effort. 

Any advice is appreciated. I'm not one to feel sorry for myself but I just needed to get this out because it is starting to weigh on me and effect my self esteem. I just feel so vulnerable in  pregnancy

Long story short, my parents are demanding and have always been selfish. They broke up more than 25 years ago, remarried but have hated each other and fighted ever since putting us kids in the middle, and only just started to patch things up for my sake because of my recent wedding.

They wanted me to have a baby shower, and they wanted it in my hometown, which is a 6 hours plus drive, 7 or 8 on a bad day. I asked for 3 things, for it to be co-ed, very casual and for them to plan it together without putting too much stress on me (namely that they would have to talk to each other rather than make me the go between like they have all my life.)

Now we're less than 2 months away and they haven't spoken, no venue has been chosen and they're both only talking to me, my Dad is stressing out like a crazy person texting and calling me nonstop and my mom hasn't been ""feeling up"" to planning but doesn't want to hand over the reins to anyone else, including me and my dad who both offered (she has anxiety and health issues I won't get into here). 

There's a lot of other drama going on, namely how will Covid affect things (things have calmed down quite a bit where we are but who knows later), but also like should we stagger the two sides of the fam since they don't speak to each other. My dad is worried my mom will have more people there than him. Petty shit. I also would have had to do a big drive down and up in under 4 days and go to thanksgiving the next day at two households, all to please my parents. None of my friends wold be able to make it because it's too far. 

So today I said I'm not doing it. We'll have one where I  live and my parents can drive up here if they want to be part of it, or Zoom in if not. My good friend has already offered to host it and it's already sounding like it will actually be fun rather than a chore.

The hospital wants me to deliver naturally, no induction, no c-section, because that's what's better ""for me"" and ""my recovery"". 

We have begged at every appointment to allow my partner to be there for labour, and because of covid they say it's just not possible right now (we are at record numbers at the moment.)

My partner and I are awaiting our second vaccination in two weeks, and then two weeks later, assuming she hasn't come early, we should be in a better position to negotiate. I've alerted the clinic that we are getting vaccinated but all they say is ""we will see when it happens, rules are rules.""

But if my partner can't be there with me, I don't want to labour for hours. Especially since we are being told we do not know if she can survive childbirth with her heart condition. I know the c-section is harder on me and longer recovery, but mentally I just don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with labor on my own (they have also said they don't do epidurals so, it's going to be a painful one.)

Ladies who have experienced one, or the other, or both? Which would you push for knowing that you'd likely be going into it alone, and your child might not survive?

Y‚Äôall are so sweet and I just wanted to give an update. I finally went to the ER after waking up to more blood. They did an ultrasound and a probe to find no heartbeat. Fetal demise. My husband and I are devastated. I could never imagine the loss I feel for something I‚Äôve never seen. Turns out I was earlier in my pregnancy (6weeks) than initially thought (11 weeks). Like my original post said I had no pain, which gave me some hope sitting in the ER waiting for the docs to give me the news. When we initially found out I was pregnant we were so excited we told EVERYONE. Now we have to tell family the bad news. Next time I will know better and wait until he 2nd trimester.

Warning, this is long and I'm adding a TW 

7/28 9 am: Check in to the OB screening room with my partner and all our bags. C-section was scheduled for 11 am.  Surprise! My mom was there waiting outside of the hospital. This was not a good surprise, she doesn‚Äôt even live in my city. I am already anxious this did not help. 

9:30a: Get seen by a nurse, she asks me when the last time I ate was? 
I say toast at 8 am. 
Uh oh! You can eat after midnight! No one told you? 
No! No one told me 
she checks my records, oh yeah we forgot to tell you that. Our bad. We have to move the procedure to 2 pm. 
I'm upset. 

10:30a: A new nurse comes in. 
What was on that toast? 
Butter. 
Oh, butter is fat. That adds two more hours. See you at 4 pm. 
I'm in tears at this point 

12-3:55p: The wait was LONG especially because I‚Äôm starving because all I‚Äôve had was the illegal buttered toast, but The Princess Bride was on, I had a book, my doula was on the way, my partner was being adorable and supportive, I‚Äôm feeling good to go. 

4p: No news
4:15p: My partner goes to find a nurse and we‚Äôre told ‚Äúsomeone will come to get you shortly‚Äù
4:30-5p: still waiting, now I‚Äôm irritated. And hungry.

5:15p Here's where things get a little crazy. The OR nurse comes to get us, sees our bags and goes ‚Äúthose should go in the car they can‚Äôt come upstairs with us‚Äù so my partner grabs all our bags and sprints to the parking garage while they take us upstairs. The nurse sends my doula to the family waiting room and takes me to the OR. This is when I find out they think I‚Äôm SOMEONE ELSE. Apparently, there was another lady scheduled for a c-section that day and they thought I was her!!! More phone calls are made. I'm ready to just try my luck with natural birth in the mountains at this point. They finally get everything figured out, tell me my partner and doula are suiting up, and start the epidural. 

5:30 they‚Äôre doing the pinching test to see if it's working, and everything is going fine until I say ""OW""
OW?! The whole OR repeats, and then it goes into overdrive, I'm numb everywhere except for a tennis ball-sized space on my right hip. Now everyone is kind of freaking out, which makes me freak out, luckily they administer local anesthesia and get started.

Stay with me dear reader it gets worse
The local wore off. 
While they were delivering my baby. I felt everything on that right side. I was not okay. Thank the heavens for my Doula and partner who saw my distress, advocated for me, and I was administered morphine, but not before they started stitching me up.

Well that's what my husband and I are doing. I'm 22 weeks. We have traveled full time (rvlife) for our entire marriage, but have to settle in one place till the baby is born. From the beginning of our marriage I have said that if I got pregnant, NO ONE would know until some time after I have the baby. My mom even told me to do it this way basically. My reasoning being that I don't like unsolicited attention or advice. I don't want to be treated differently. I don't want comments about my body (I'm very thin and I know my sister will complain that I'm so skinny during my pregnancy while she feels she wasn't [she was]). I don't want it to be the only thing people can talk to me about. My husband is totally on board and loves the idea.

I took the same approach when I got engaged. I only told the people I wanted in my wedding party, and then eventually the people I invited to the wedding knew. It was an unplugged wedding (no photos or social media) and I didn't announce publicly that I got married until like a week or so AFTER the wedding. I just don't like my life public.

On my side of the family, this is expected behavior from me. My parents are non-intrusive, don't assume or pry. My mom LOVES kids (she's a teacher), but she has never asked any of my siblings when we were having kids or made any comments about grandkids. She said she'd rather us have our lives together. My extended family and even friends don't ask those types of intrusive questions (WhEn ArE yOu HaViNg KiDs).

My husband's family, on the other hand, is not like that. I've come to realize recently that my mother-in-law can be intrusive, and she has had plenty of comments/questions I would consider rude (and I generally don't register it immediately because I've never had to deal with it from family members). My husband said that if his mom knew I was pregnant, EVERYONE would know. So, even though we have been around both our families this summer while I was in my first trimester/early second trimester, I've been deliberate about keeping it a secret.

We relocated up to a new england state to be away from most people we know. My husband's brothers have a farm out here we are staying at, but they work on the west coast till like Christmas, which is around my due date. So it seemed like the best place since no one is around. My husband has a couple aunt's/uncles up here, but we don't really see them.

In July, my husband's aunt asked if I was expecting, out of the blue. He asked why she thought that (and denied it). She basically saw a picture of me holding my baby nephews and somehow thought I was having a baby (no idea of the logic)?? But it's just so intrusive to me because, as I said, my family does not ask questions like that. Especially family members that we hardly talk to. (Why are you all the sudden interested in me if I'm having a baby? Am I not interesting enough as a person without a child??)

Then, my husband's uncle wanted to do lunch with us yesterday because he just came back into the country. I was like, 'OK, it's fine, I'm wearing a dress that hides my bump pretty well and I can suck in. I don't want to seem suspicious by avoiding everyone.' Thankfully it was easy to hide and nothing was suspected. BUT his uncle asked when we were having kids!!1! *rage* My husband lied, obviously, but I'm just like, 'dude, what is up with your family??' I also don't really like this uncle, I used to work for him and he has a shady past and he's just kind of... creepy. Thankfully he spends a lot of time out of the country, but I don't really want to have my kid around him regardless.

SO TODAY, my husband was talking to his mom on the phone. Then he texts me and tells me his mom is coming up here to visit her siblings TWICE next month. I'm like 'wtf, why now?!' She visited up here last year and gave me the impression it wasn't a normal thing. We literally came up here to avoid everyone and have the baby in peace, and now suddenly his family is intrusive üò§

It would be easier to deal with if it was my family because 1) they don't ask questions, and 2) I know how to respond to them. And honestly I have an inkling that my mom knows I'm pregnant (we were around her when I was 18 w), but she definitely wouldn't say anything unless I said something first.

I'm just frustrated with all this happening now after we've taken measures to avoid people. And I needed somewhere to rant to spare my husband the brunt of it haha. My husband said we could leave for those times his mom is visiting, and I have been wanting to take a baby moon (to Hawaii, the only state we haven't been to). So we may just do that!

Hi, I'm 5w4d :) Earlier this year, my husband and I lost our first pregnancy at 6w due to a blighted ovum. I took it pretty hard - perhaps due to the circumstances under which we found out. We had been trying for 6 months without success so I saw my GP for a chat. She recommended that I got my blood work done. I was 3-day late for my period so she thought she'd throw in a pregnancy test as well. The following she called to say that I was pregnant and she had been waiting all day to pass on the news! It was exhilarating because I really wasn't expecting that! A few days later I started spotting and a week later, our miscarriage was confirmed. Around the same time, a colleague at work who sat next to me announced her pregnancy ... It was the one of hardest conversations I've ever been in. I also worked with very little children and my work itself was often a trigger. I saw a counsellor which did help me feel ready to try again. 

Now that I'm pregnant again, I'm trying to be 'cautiously optimistic' as my husband said. But I can't help but worry. Each time I wipe or get my blood done at the pathology or get slightly ahead of myself and read about childcare or maternity leave policy, I feel scared and worried. Yesterday the pathologist excitedly asked if this is my first pregnancy. I didn't know how to answer it without over sharing. I also very quickly thought maybe I should be excited but what if ... (I know what my psychologist would say to this but ...)

My boyfriend is wonderful and his family is very sweet and supportive but I miss my own family so much. I have 4 siblings (most half sibs) 3 brothers ages 10,17, and 21, and one little sister who‚Äôs 7. My mom and stepdad are severely disappointed in me and my decisions for divorcing my physically abusive ex in the arranged marriage pushed on me by the church. We were only married for 6 months and I hardly knew him. 

Now I‚Äôm with someone who I‚Äôve known for years and who I‚Äôve always had feelings for and he actually makes me happy, and truly is the man of my dreams. He is so excited to be a dad and takes great care of me. Cooks me food, puts socks on my feet when they‚Äôre cold, rubs vapor rub on my chest, cleans out my throw up bin, gives me massages, is patient with me and understanding of my moods. He‚Äôs everything I never thought I would find in a partner. 

this is supposed to be a happy time in my life as I‚Äôve always known I wanted to be a mother. but instead, per orders of the religion/church, since divorce is a sin, I‚Äôm being shunned by my whole family (and have been since January) and it feels so lonely all the time. They‚Äôre required to have no contact with me whatsoever. No visits, no texts, no FaceTime, no calls. Was announced on the stage at their midweek meeting that I‚Äôm to be shunned by everyone. I haven‚Äôt been invited over for a meal or stepped foot into the place I used to call home just last year before moving out, since the middle of December. Same with all my friends. Everyone has me blocked on everything and if they haven‚Äôt blocked me, they just recant my mistakes from the gossip they‚Äôve heard and call me a low life. I feel like such a failure. 

I cry constantly and feel immense jealousy over all the people in this subreddit who talk about their parents being excited and I just want that for me. I feel so angry that I even told my mom because it‚Äôs like now she just took advantage of my emotions and just used being pregnant to make me feel like an even bigger pile of shit, and that it could all be fixed if I just break up with my boyfriend, come home, and join the religion again. And my stepdad who‚Äôs been in my life since I was 8 just follows my moms pursuit. Just declines all my calls and answers none of my texts. I feel humiliated every time I break down and try to call them just to be reminded that me and this baby are not wanted. I used to matter. I miss mattering. 

I‚Äôve only been moved out for a little over a year, and even knowing my struggles and watching me fall face down repeatedly because I just need help, with bills, with getting a new car because mine broke down and had to be towed, with doctors appointments and my mom to hold my hand like she used to just a year ago because I‚Äôm still so scared,  my parents still choose everyday to shun me and to keep all my siblings from me since they all still live there and it‚Äôs their house, their rules.

Just on the lookout for others who may have experienced the same as what I am. I'll caveat this with: I'm meant to chat with my doc in the next few days to get legit medical advice. I'm just looking for anecdotal feedback from y'all to try and keep me from obsessively Googling.

Found out about 2 weeks ago I was pregnant via multiple (so much pee on my hands) home pregnancy tests. Then went to the doc to confirm and chat next steps. This is where my perplexing  journey begins. 

I went in at about 5 weeks (per my app, could have been off +/- a few days, for sure) and the urine test I took at the doc was negative. She told me not to worry as the tests they have in the office are ""crappy"" and that I should rely on the home tests as they are ""more sensitive"". I went home, took two more tests and they were positive. 

So the next day I start spotting. Cool, cool, cool. Assumed that since the doc's pregnancy test was negative this could indicate that my HCG was on the down turn and I was en route to a chemical pregnancy.  The spotting is between brown to light pink and has not been enough to fill a pad, except for an episode of bright red bleeding that happened only once and not since.

It's been a week since then and:

1) I took another pregnancy test and it's still positive

2) my spotting has not gotten worse, but I am still spotting (pretty light pink rn)

3) I have little to no cramping

4) my breasts are still sore, I'm urinating frequently and I feel like I can smell everything. 

So yeah, no idea what's happening. Feeling very frustrated as my first ultrasound isn't scheduled for another 3 weeks to provide any definitive conclusion.

Has anyone else experience this series of events?

I've had a super stuffy nose for about 2 weeks now, with a wicked post nasal drip that makes me cough. It's not covid - I've been tested 6 times so far - and it's not viral. It's just the stuffy nose a lot of pregnant people get. But last night I coughed so hard and felt a pop and had a blinding pain in my right side that did not go away with heat and Paracetamol and kept me from breathing normally. After fighting with it for about an hour at home with nothing helping and me realizing I cannot deal with this pain, my husband drove us to the ER. 

The ER nurse took one look at my belly and sent me to L&amp;D, even though I had explained what the problem was, with the excuse ""our normal ER doctors don't know what to do with a pregnant person"". 

So we went to L&amp;D, where we sat around for 3 hours before someone could even see us because a) my problem was not ""acute"" and b) I wasn't in labor as several other women were. 

Got to spend a good 3 further hours hooked up to a CTG / NST machine and with an ultrasound to be told ""everything looks good, it's nothing with the baby.""

No duh... my pain was at least 4 inches above where my uterus stops and clearly focused over my lung / side flank. 

So they put together a file saying baby is fine and send me back to the ER. The doctor there does an EKG, Lung test, blood test, heart and blood pressure monitoring (another 3ish hours). To come to the conclusion - I probably pulled or possibly even tore a muscle coughing.  

Yes, thank you. I knew that when I walked in at midnight. The whole point was to help me get some relief from the blinding pain I was experiencing due to it.

Ah, well. You're pregnant. You can take Paracetamol, but it won't actually help if it is a muscle tear. You'd need an NSAID or opiate to touch that pain, neither of which we can give you. 

Something to stop me from coughing and making it worse then? No. There are no cough suppressants deemed safe for pregnancy in my country. 

So what'd the doctor do? Brought me two Paracetamol and a bottle of water, disconnected the EKG, and wished me the best of luck. He said it should all clear up when I give birth in 2-3 weeks because the coughing and stuffy nose will disappear latest then.

As does, ""You need electrolytes, not that"" in response to my choice to have a little soda rather than water.

I‚Äôm a little confused and scared. Wondering if anyone has had the same sort of experience as I am having now. For context, Flo app says I‚Äôm 5+6. 

Yesterday morning, I had sex with my husband before leaving for work. Immediately after sex, I noticed some pink when I wiped but didn‚Äôt think much of it. I went to work and around 3 hours later, I was wiping bright red. At this time, I also began experiencing mild cramping. 

I panicked and headed to the ER. After waiting several hours, I finally got some sort of result. 

They said my HCG is fairly low, around 350. Ultrasounds showed nothing so far and they told me my dates must be wrong. However, that‚Äôs not really possible. I track my periods (and sexual activity) religiously, as we‚Äôve been ttc for around four months now. Got a diagnosis of a threatened miscarriage with instructions to have my hormones retested in the next couple of days. 

As I was leaving the hospital, the bleeding increased. At this point I was certain something was wrong. By the time I got home, I passed a few small clots. I resigned myself to the worst outcome and had a good cry. 

However, by the time I had gone to sleep, (2 hours later) my bleeding had mostly ceased. Very light amount of blood, not even enough to warrant a liner. 

This morning, I‚Äôm just spotting a little bit here and there. 

My biggest concern is I‚Äôm experiencing ectopic pregnancy and they brushed me off. I have an appointment early this afternoon to have my hormones tested again.

So I‚Äôm 36 weeks as of yesterday. I can take maternity until 2 weeks before my due date. I might have a work around but it would be playing the system.

I ended up going in at 10pm Friday so they could start me on Cervadil and so I could rest. They got the Cervadil in around 10:45pm, and gave me an Ambien so I could get some sleep. The Ambien started to work, and then the contraction pain ended up overpowering the want to sleep. My hips felt like they were being torn in half. I called in the nurse for something to help. Embarrassing being so early, but my pain tolerance is stupid low. She decided on a cervix check and then gave me Nubain in my IV. During the check she seemed really frustrated with me. It hurt really bad when she went in the first time, almost like my vagina was being stabbed with her nails. The second time she tried I felt like I was annoying her bc it hurt even worse and she just shoved her fingers in. 
I hadn‚Äôt dilated at all at that point, so I was confused as to why my contractions were so bad.. it was about 3am when this happened. After she administered the pain relief I went to sleep.
I woke up at 5am to pee, getting up HURT. My vagina had swollen to the point it felt closed shut. It scared me and I started crying hysterically while trying to pee because I could hardly pee. The only other time this happened was when I was sexually assaulted, so I think me feeling that pain is what brought such a negative reaction. I called her back in because I was confused as to why it hurt so bad. I told her I didn‚Äôt think I could physically handle another cervix check until the swelling had gone down. She told me she would have day shift nurse come in and check, gave me another IV of the Nubain, which knocked me back out. I managed to sleep until about 9:30am. Day shift nurse and the midwife on call saw I was awake and came in and asked to do a cervix check. I started crying again because between the consistent contractions and the vag still being SUPER SWOLLEN I didnt think I could handle it. She told me there wasn‚Äôt anything they could really do moving forward with induction until they knew if I had progressed at all. I reluctantly agreed, and she was very careful about it. Nurse with her held my hand. Turns out at some point my cervadil had fallen all the way down to the opening of my vagina basically, and that‚Äôs probably a big reason as to why I was so swollen. I wasn‚Äôt sure when it had gotten to this point, or if my body rejected it or what. My cervix made absolutely no progress though. She told me the best thing for me to do moving forward was to go home and let me heal, because trying to move forward would likely end up with a c section and that with the state of my bits that they didnt think I would take too kindly to them doing a balloon. I feel so defeated. Labor signs have stopped almost completely. I am rather pissed at my body, and at baby, for both refusing to make progress (as irrational as it is) and I have been bouncing between inconsolably crying or sleeping since I got home. I am past my due date and I just want this to end. I felt like I went through 12 hours of trying to progress to come home and have more bullshit BH contractions.

(Transmission rates in our area were low when we sent invitations out, but we sure feel like fools now.) We also planned an out-of-state honeymoon. Where we're going, it'd be easy enough to take COVID precautions but I am worried about the airport/flying. I will have just entered my second trimester for all of this.

With Delta/breakthrough infections on the rise, plus this surprise pregnancy, I'm slowly accepting that all of our plans will have to change in some way. I know for a fact that most attendees are vaccinated, but a few extended family members are not. And, a few guests would be traveling from other states. 

I know we need a game plan but the thing is, my head is spinning. Between this insane fatigue, trying to figure out what I can and cannot eat, and navigating COVID in general, my problem-solving skills are failing me. Anyone been in a similar situation have advice on how to approach it?

Some ideas floating around in my head: 

* Ask everyone to wear masks 
* Find a compassionate way to ask out-of-state guests not to come, and maybe offer to visit them once it's safe to do so 
* Drastically reduce the guest list altogether (&lt;50 ppl), to include only people we know are vaccinated

And... maybe I'm still in denial, but... do we need to cancel our honeymoon? Maybe go somewhere within driving distance?

I'm a FTM, currently 6 weeks postpartum.

For a bit of backstory, I had severe hyperemisis during my pregnancy and was hospitalised twice during the first trimester. I was eventually given Ondansetron (Zofran) which made a difference. The HG did mean that I would be provided with extra scans from 30 weeks to check baby's growth.
My pregnancy was otherwise OK and enjoyable despite pretty bad SPD and edema in the last trimester. As it was Covid, my husband was not allowed with me to any of my admissions or appointments bar one 20 week scan. 

At my 30 week scan they noted baby was at 95th centile, cue me starting to be nervous. At the next scan they said baby was 65th centile but the previous scanner had made a mistake and misplotted and the baby should have been 100th centile. Urm what. So then they were concerned the baby had stopped growing. Cue me being tested for GD at 34 weeks, I was negative. As I was still quite small, we just hoped the first scan was a total misread. The next scan put baby back at 95th centile, cue me doing everything I can to get the baby to come, but nothing happens. Final scan at 38+6, and the baby was measured as close to 100th centile and with an estimated weight of 8lbs7oz. Great, I was feeling nervous as hell. At that appt I had to do urine sample and bp. My BP came back high on several tests and my urine had some protein in.
The doctor came and said I was showing signs of pre-eclampsia and I would need to be admitted and induced (she wasn't fussed about baby's size too much and I was kind of relieved). FYI all subsequent tests had my BP in a normal range and my urine only had minimal protein, so whether I had PE or not is still up for debate.

Anyways, that was 9am on the Friday, at 12.30 I was induced with a pessary and admitted to the mat ward. My husband was allowed in for a bit. Nothing happened that day whatsoever, I was only 1cm dilated. Next day, still nothing, no contractions at all.
At 12.30 on the Saturday they tried another pessary. Husband allowed in again, we went for a walk in the grounds, still nothing. I was feeling fine.

At 7pm on the Saturday, they said they would take me to the labour ward, break my waters and induce with a hormone drip. Cool.
Walked down there at around 8.30pm. Soon after they broke my waters, the midwife actually really struggled and wasn't sure she could even do it as I was still 1cm dilated. She got it though and I was out on the drip at that point too. She reckoned we'd be in for a long night. Just after 9 I told my husband to go home and rest and sort the dog out etc. I had nothing happening when he left.

About 30 minutes later, I was beginning to feel 'tightenings'. I took some practice breaths on the gas and air. At 10.20 I asked my husband to come back as 'it was getting a bit ouchy'. When he got back just before 11, I was still chatting, but on gas and air.
Things really started to ramp up all of a sudden though. About 15 minutes later I said to my midwife I need either morphine or epidural. She had a concerned look that I was requesting pain relief so soon, but suggested the epidural, I agreed. By 11.30 I could hardly breathe, contractions had gone wild and it was essentially non stop 1 minute contractions of the most horrendous pain. They stopped the drip and I requested (screamed for) morphine.

At this point I was panicking about how I could do this for another 8-10 hours, I thought I would die. I kept spitting the gas out and saying I couldn't do it. I didn't understand. Now I was just screaming/wailing consistently, before my midwife called another midwife, they asked me if I needed to push. I didn't know, I didn't understand what I was feeling as an hour before I'd been fine.

The midwife took a look and said OMG there's your baby's head, she has so much hair! Despite the pain, I felt a wave of relief that it was almost over! It was about 20 to midnight and they weren't sure if I would have a Saturday or Sunday baby. Someone came in and jabbed me in the leg with morphine. I was still confused about what I needed to do, but my body seemed to be taking over. It took me a minute to listen to my husband and the midwives telling me when to push. It was only 4 or 5 pushes and my baby girl was out. Incredible relief. She was born at 23.50 on the Saturday weighing 7lb2oz (way under what they predicted). Placenta popped out soon after, even more very satisfying relief. 

After she was born, the morphine kicked in and I was pretty high. Then the anaesthesist turned up for the epidural.. Haha!. I had a 3rd degree tear, the midwife said this wasn't a surprise as my body hadn't had time to adjust. I was sent for surgery where I ended up having a spinal anyway. FYI, I didn't find the injection particularly painful (may have been because of the morphine though). It was mostly discomfort and the worst but was her pressing on my ribs to figure out where to inject I guess. Also, afterwards they put your legs down from the stirrups, but because they were numb they still felt like they were up, really odd sensation.

Everything was still a blur. But we had a healthy baby to take home on the Sunday afternoon. When my midwife said bye, she said she'd only seen something so fast once in her career before. 

The first week of recovery wasn't so bad. The tearing and stitches was all on the inside so there were no issues peeing, and despite all my fears, pooping went OK too. It was all just puffy and swollen. My back felt sore from the spinal. Where they stuck my leg with morphine turned into a giant swollen bruise.

One surprising thing was that when my uterus wa a contracting back over the next few days, I did have pretty horrible flashbacks that left me panicking and sweating. They did pass though, and I can look back OK now.

I've been recommended a section next time due to the tear from this time. We'll see, I am open to that.
On reflection, I may not go for extra scans next time as they led to lots of anxiety, and are definitely not accurate. Inductions are not always this horrendously long experience, however, I would have liked more time to be able to acclimatise and adjust to what was happening (physically and mentally). And, its crazy what the body can do, it really does take over and get things done. And the 'end product' aka our beautiful baby daughter made everything so worth it, and although she has the worst reflux and is very grizzly right now, I wouldn't change a thing. 

Apologies for the crazy essay, I've probably missed a ton of stuff out. Feel free to ask any questions.

I told him when I bought it to please not eat ANY because it's my special treat. It takes me a long time to eat any treats because I have been so sick, especially in the evenings when I would usually eat ice cream.  

I bought him an entire box of drumsticks and said he could have them all but PLEASE don't touch my ice cream. Well today I feel pretty decent and figured it's the perfect time to dive into some tasty treats a la brownie batter core heaven. 

I happily skip over the the freezer, open it, grab the pint and immediately notice it feels a lot lighter than expected. My heart sank, I could feel the rage start to rise within me while I open it and not only did he eat some of my ice cream but he ate THE ENTIRE BROWNIE BATTER CORE which is obviously the BEST PART. 

SO dear reader, what do I do but immediately start yell-crying at my husband. ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU TO NOT TOUCH THIS AND YOU ATE THE BEST PART"" literally sobbing to the point I can barely breath and he can barely understand what I'm saying. Then I hide in my office eating the remnants of his massacre with no brownie batter or chunks in sight. 

He apologized but also laughed at me, which I guess is fair because who sobs over ice cream, but IT'S ALL I HAVE. I can't drink wine or beer. I can't smoke weed. There's a long list of things I cannot do while he can do whatever he wants and yet he still shows such little self control to not eat my ONE special treat?

I asked my SO, but all he said was to serve drinks and well that just doesn't sit well with me when I could do more for them. Especially since there will be unloading being done I want to be replenished. Its about a 1¬Ω-2 hour drive back to their hometown and I don't want them driving back on empty tummies either since the only thing that's really available here is fast food. 

What are some low carb delicious treats or snacks or anything else you enjoy or make? Any good websites I could look at?

Sorry that it‚Äôs long in advance.

I‚Äôm almost 40yo and 24 weeks pregnant. I haven‚Äôt gained much weight. Maybe ten pounds but I don‚Äôt fit into any of my usual clothes. Pre- pregnancy I was a size 0-2 and while I never felt that attractive I‚Äôve also never been that insecure about my looks. Lately I‚Äôve only been able to wear huge baggy overalls and I don‚Äôt feel very attractive even though my husband will get jealous and complain that our realtor has a crush on me. (He‚Äôs a jealous person and it is irritating)

Last week my husband and I went to check out the small town we will be moving to. We chose a nice restaurant in town for dinner and sat at the bar. My husband often is a little annoyed at me and ordering a non alcoholic drink became a bit of a flustered situation. The bartender seemed reluctant to offer anything and apparently my husband thought I was too boring if I ordered a cranberry with seltzer. Whatever. 

As usual the bartender started to chat but her shatter was more directed at husband and found out that we were buying a house. I also interjected here and there but there‚Äôs that situation where you feel like a third wheel because you try to make eye contact with the third person but they only look at your husband while they talk and my husband wasn‚Äôt helping. He was telling her we were moving out here because the crime rate in our area was insane right now. Normally he would also say that I‚Äôm expecting but he didn‚Äôt this time.

I get that bartenders work for tips. I wasn‚Äôt drinking and female bartenders tend to sweet talk the men and I‚Äôm sure she assumed he was be paying so I don‚Äôt hold it against her working for her tip. I just didn‚Äôt like that my husband was responding while I was next to him. I noticed she was about a decade younger than me and very slim with a tiny waist. A similar body type to what I had at her age and very much my husbands type.

I felt left out but ignored the feeling because I don‚Äôt want to be ridiculous. At some point after we started eating and she left we started talking to a couple next to my husband and I felt better because I was able to engage them when I spoke up. I felt a lot better. I got up because I needed to use the bathroom and told my husband so. The bump was finally showing a little and getting in the way so I was stuck and I told my husband that my belly was finally big enough to get in the way. We had a giggle and he helped me move the stool so I could get out. I thought it was such a sweet moment I gave him a kiss and walked towards the bathroom with a look back at him smiling. It felt like such a warm fuzzy moment to me.

Now I still felt nervous about the bartender so I didn‚Äôt dawdle but moving around while pregnant in a bathroom with overalls is not easy. As I exited the bathroom I noticed right away that my husband was smiling and engaged in conversation with the bartender again. When I approached my husband didn‚Äôt notice so I placed a hand on him before I climbed back onto my stool to let him know I was there. He was surprised and the conversation stopped so I had no idea what it was about. So I said hey what are you guys talking about and the bartender kind of steps back a bit and said something along the lines of how safe the area is. She said the schools here are very good. She attended the schools here and so do her kids. My husband said oh you have kids?! After she answered that she has two he was like oh yes that‚Äôs actually one of the biggest, well actually the biggest why we‚Äôre moving here! He finally indicates me and said we‚Äôre expecting!

The waitress‚Äôs face kind of froze a little before she finally looked up at me clearly that night and engaged with me to talk about kids and schools. To me it felt like she just felt bad for me because she had been ignoring me the entire night and could probably tell my husband was very engaged in talking with her. We left ten minutes later after exchanging phone numbers. 

As we got into the car my husband asked if I‚Äôd needed to go to the bathroom. I said I just went! Then he proceeded to talk about how surprised he was that our waitress was a mother of two because she didn‚Äôt look like it. It bothers me that he seemed to forget that moment we had together so quickly but I tried to brush it aside to say well she looks to be almost thirty so I‚Äôm not surprised and he said really?! At some point I finally asked him if he really forgot I went to the bathroom and he said did you? I didn‚Äôt notice and I told him that I thought he forgot because he was attracted and distracted by the bartender. He then claims that he doesn‚Äôt even remember what she looked like even though he usually is the one to recall what someone looks like better than I can and he has just said she didn‚Äôt look like a mother of two. At some point he said if he didn‚Äôt remember something it was because it wasn‚Äôt memorable. I felt like I was doused with cold water because to me it was the first time the bump got in the way. My husband and I only recently married and we don‚Äôt live together so I also only see him on weekends. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs around to see the bump grow slowly. Every time he sees it there‚Äôs a pretty big change especially now.

At some level I know it‚Äôs probably unreasonable to expect everyone to feel the same way about a moment together but at the same time I feel like I was just forgotten.

I was in a relationship for six years that ended after he was fired for sexually harassing minors (he was 30), and a few months after that I met my (now) husband through long distance dating.

I moved across the country, quit my job, gave up my apartment and seeing my family for him. I ended up pregnant within two weeks. 

That's when it hit me. As soon as I got that positive test, I did have some genuine happiness, but it was mostly shrouded in dread. And that dread has continued to grow and grow throughout this entire pregnancy. I've told my husband and my family how I've felt, and they've all assured me that it'll be different after I give birth and see my child, but I'm just not as convinced.

This will be a rollercoaster of a story, so bear with me, haha.

In mid-April, I got the contraceptive implant in my arm. Nexplanon. Before that, I was on birth control pills. So, in between the beginning of April to my appointment for Nexplanon, there were a few days I had forgotten to take the pill. I checked in my tracker app now (to see when the baby was possibly conceived) that it was during my ovulation period.

How did I not know I could be pregnant? I know that with Nexplanon, there's a possibility that your period stops. I have a friend who's on the same and her period stopped as well. That happened to me, too. So I didn't think much of it. I overlooked the symptoms of first term pregnancy because I thought it was my hormones changing from the Nexplanon: breast enlargement, slight nausea without vomiting, headaches, fatigue, mood swings.

So, point is, I am conflicted with my feelings. I know I'm not prepared to be a mother financially and situationally. Seeing as I'm almost halfway through my pregnancy, though, abortion will be hard. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to see the possibilities, but I can't help but to picture myself keeping the baby. If the option of a late-abortion/late-termination is there, I'll take it. If not? I don't know. My heart is growing attached to this person growing inside me and I smile every time I feel those small flutters.

My family (which consists of only my dad) is supportive with whatever option I go for. My boyfriend's (21) family, I'm unsure, because we don't plan to tell them until after Tuesday when we find things out. But from as far as I've known them, I have a strong feeling they will help.

As far as my feelings go, I'm hopeful of becoming a young mother if it comes to that. It will be hard, I understand, but I've gone through Plans A, B, C, D... in my head.

The pregnancy itself was unexpected, and my partner was very unsupportive. It was a whirlwind, to say the least. 

Over the next few months following the loss, I had been so ‚Äúsick‚Äù every day. Constant headaches, nausea, lightheadedness, fatigue‚Ä¶ I was wracking my brain wondering what could be wrong with me. After about a month and a half of these symptoms, I had my partner take me to an Urgent Care. I explained to them that I had recently miscarried, and that I was suspicious these symptoms were connected. They took my blood and urine, concluding I had a stomach bug, and sent me on my way‚Ä¶ $350 dollars poorer. 

Another two months of these symptoms persisting, and I finally decided to go to the ER. The ER staff took my blood and urine while I was waiting for a room, and I was informed that the tests displayed that I may be pregnant. I didn‚Äôt panic, as I have had false negatives in the past. It was a Saturday afternoon, so it took around 6 hours to get back to a room. By this time, my boyfriend was starving and went to grab some food while I waited for a doctor. About ten minutes after he left, I was taken back to a room. To my surprise, I was immediately whisked away to get an ultrasound.

The radiologist began the internal exam as we chatted about my last pregnancy. She turned the screen to me, revealing a seemingly HUGE silhouette of a tiny human. I was pregnant the whole time, 15 weeks along. The Urgent Care took my blood and urine two months prior, with no mention of pregnancy. I was confused. The exact date of conception was the same date I went to the same hospital for my miscarriage. Regardless, I asked if everything looked normal with my baby; she said it appeared so. 

I told my parents and my partner, and after about an hour my boyfriend returned. We waited another 2 hours to get the official results, and headed home. 

I am shocked, but excited. Not knowing I was pregnant, I had done essentially everything you shouldn‚Äôt do in your first trimester, and then some. I have a lot of anxieties before my first real appointment this Tuesday, but am praying for the best.

We came home and I cried. I felt so disgusting and ‚Äúchubby‚Äù. I‚Äôve struggled with super low self esteem since I was a kid and this hit me in the emotional crotch. 

The thing is- I‚Äôm not even overweight or obese!! I‚Äôm just an average girl. 5‚Äô4,150 pounds. 

My husband was more upset about these comments than I was initially Bc they happened at a backyard bbq and everyone heard. He told me at home that while I just kinda shrugged it off he could see how much it hurt me. I just focused on not crying for the next two hours until we could leave.

Pre-pandemic, my husband was supposed to be in a play. It‚Äôs semi-professional (he gets a stipend), but extracurricular to his job. Rehearsals are 5-6 days/week, including at least one weekend day, and husband is currently working 6 days/week. He is fully vaccinated, I will be fully vaccinated by the time rehearsals start, and I‚Äôve been assured that everyone will be fully masked for the rehearsal process.

They‚Äôd like to put the show up this fall. The final performance is about 3 weeks before my due date.

I actually really want him to do this. It brings him a lot of joy, and he has had almost no outlet creatively for the last year and a half. I was literally just saying to my mother that I wish that he would have the opportunity to do a show before the baby comes. But I‚Äôm having a lot of conflicted feelings now that it‚Äôs come up.

-I‚Äôm feeling sad/a little resentful that the last bonding time that we are a family of two will largely be cut down. We are both usually social/busy people when there‚Äôs not a pandemic, and I‚Äôve gotten kind of spoiled by the last year and a half of it just being us most of the time.
-I‚Äôm feeling almost a little angry that he wants to do it (EVEN though I had wanted this for him and it will be his last opportunity for potentially a long time).
-I‚Äôm feeling nervous about how rigid they‚Äôre going to be with Covid restrictions. He‚Äôs been responsible overall but I can feel him getting more lax/I‚Äôve recently had to remind him to wear his mask properly for me/the baby‚Äôs safety.
-I‚Äôm feeling resentful about the fact that this usually means I need to take over the bulk of meal planning, cooking, baby prep, and cleaning for the duration of the rehearsal process, and that especially with pandemic it means I‚Äôm going to be largely alone for my third trimester.
-I‚Äôm feeling nervous about the possibility that I could go into preterm labor. I did tell him that I‚Äôm only comfortable with him doing it if they can arrange an understudy.

I think this would be great for him but I also don‚Äôt want to have to make these sacrifices when I‚Äôm going through so much. I do feel certain that he would turn it down if I asked him to.

I went in for my weekly OB visit on August 3rd, 2 weeks after my cerclage removal (I was diagnosed with short cervix at 22 weeks which is when it was placed) knowing I was already 1cm dilated and hopeful that I had made some sort of progress. Before my doc could do a cervix check, she noticed my elevated bp (145/80) and she said she‚Äôd like to have me induced for safety, plus baby was big (estimated weight of 8lbs) and he would be fine. I was nervous but really excited - it was finally happening! She gave me two hours to go home to get my things and my husband and we came back to the hospital at 4pm to get checked in.

By 6pm we were checked into our hospital room, a cervix check determined that I was already at 2cm dilated, and the monitors were picking up mild but regular contractions that I wasn‚Äôt feeling at all. They placed a foley balloon catheter (uncomfortable but fine) to help my cervix open up to a 3 which took no time at all, and had me on pitocin to help my contractions along. Contractions started becoming painful so I got my [first] epidural at midnight - placement was fine, relief was quick, and they broke my water at 2am when I was at 4cm dilated. My husband and I napped through most of the night and by 11am I was 7cm dilated. Baby was having some decels during the bigger contractions so they put me on my left side which made him happier, but I started noticing a lot of pain in my back after a while. Baby had been face down for most of my pregnancy and had turned slightly (but we managed to get him turned back) so I just chalked it up to that. Multiple times I requested top-offs of my epidural because I was feeling contractions on my right side and having very severe back pain. They tried shifting me around and monitoring baby, but the pain persisted. 

By 4pm I was fully dilated and we started pushing. Breathing the right way and pushing with numbness from the epidural was really difficult for me, and on top of this my back pain was so much worse - I‚Äôm not talking back labor back pain, I‚Äôm talking from my neck all the way to my lower back, lightning pains and spasms and tension that I could not relieve no matter what I did. It was honestly hell. I was crying, pushing, baby was not descending, we tried multiple different pushing positions and nothing. My progress had stalled, my back was on fire, and then I started noticing that every time anesthesia came by to top off my epidural it would send my back into spasm - I have no idea why, the doctors never determined the cause, but at this point the anesthesia was making my pain WORSE and on top of that, it stopped working at all to numb my contractions, which were horrendously painful. 

At 8pm, after 4 hours of pushing, we decided c section was the best option. I was openly bawling at this point, in pain I couldn‚Äôt relieve, terrified and disappointed. We discussed what this would mean in terms of anesthesia given how it wasn‚Äôt working for me, so they decided to try to place a second epidural to see if that would work. At first, it provided some relief, but this was extremely short lived. My back went into spasm again, I could feel my contractions fully, and there was nothing I could do. 

They rolled me into the OR and assured me they would try to get the epidural working and test it out before proceeding. So they laid me on the table, my back was in so much pain I could barely stay still and was crying, my husband was holding my head and kissing me and reassuring me. They gave me the stronger epidural dose which is supposed to completely numb you, and said they would test it out. So they go to start cutting me, and immediately I could feel everything they were doing - I hope I don‚Äôt have to go into a terribly detailed description of what it‚Äôs like having yourself cut open and being able to feel it. After crying and saying ‚ÄúOW OW OW‚Äù they immediately said the thing I‚Äôd feared the most - general anesthesia - and ushered my husband out of the OR. 

I was out within minutes, and woke up after what felt like 1 second, groggy and a mess, to someone offering me a bundle and asking if I wanted to hold him. I immediately said yes, hugged my perfect baby boy to my chest and started crying yet again. My husband met us in recovery minutes later and I showed him our beautiful son and cried some more while he held both of us. He told me that while he wasn‚Äôt able to be in the room, he heard his first cries while he was pacing up and down the hall outside the OR and that made me so happy, that at least one of us could have been there for that. Our son Lucian was born on August 4th, 2021 at 10:34pm, 20 inches long and 8lbs9oz; they determined during my surgery that he was just a bit too big to make it out naturally which explained his arrested descent.

They kept us in recovery for about 8 hours because my O2 sats were low. My poor husband had to sit in this horribly uncomfortable stool the whole time. Throughout this time in recovery I was vaguely aware of some heavy bleeding and gushing coming from my vagina every time they checked and changed my dressings, but none of the nurses said anything so I thought it was normal. Finally they got us a post-partum recovery room and we were wheeled out. We got to the floor and a doctor came to check me out, and immediately noticed that every time I moved my hips for my dressing replacement, blood was gushing out of me (my labia were extremely swollen from my unproductive pushing so she reasoned that the swelling must have held in the majority of the hemorrhage and was only coming out when I moved). 15 doctors and nurses immediately entered the room, watched as I moved my hips up and down and was gushing blood, and saying very scary things like needing to bring me back downstairs. They were pushing on my [freshly cut open] belly to see if more blood would come out, I was crying again and miserable, they gave me an ultrasound which showed some blood clots in my uterus. So the lead doctor there told me they would have to manually remove the clots. I had no idea what this entailed. Well, turns out it meant she was going to stick her hand into my vagina, through my still-dilated cervix and into my uterus to scrape out the clots. I was unmedicated and started screaming and crying; it had to be one of the most painful things I‚Äôd ever experienced, which says a lot seeing how high the bar had already been set during my labor. They managed to remove some clots, but returned an hour or so later to repeat this same procedure. We were kept in the hospital for 3 days and finally got home last night with our son who, aside from needing phototherapy for high bilirubin, is perfect and has been a singular source of complete joy for me.

I‚Äôm not sure how I made it through. I feel genuinely traumatized, and my mind has already begun the process of blocking out the worst of my memories of those days.

Tonight he hung out with a friend and I guess he realized he can‚Äôt be as free as he could be without a kid. His friends don‚Äôt have kids and they can do whatever. He complained that he‚Äôs still young and can‚Äôt go to parties anymore. 

I tell him he could still do those things I mean at the expense of myself because I‚Äôd end up having to stay home.

I‚Äôm not the party type anyway I just want to go on vacations lol. 

So idk what to do if he decides to leave because it‚Äôs too much for him. Before he was acting like he couldn‚Äôt wait to meet her and was saying how much he loved her. Now he‚Äôs telling me he isn‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôm 35+5 so there‚Äôs not much we can do now. And no I have no plans of putting my daughter up for adoption.

saturday morning rolls around and around 1am I wake up w some cramping. like the kind that tell you uh oh i‚Äôm about to get my period. not unusual, but my minds racing bc i‚Äôm dying to get this baby out of me. i finally fall back asleep and wake up to what looks like I peed my pants a little. also not an unusual sight w the amount of discharge and unknown substances coming out of my downstairs mix up. then, the mucus plug arrives. I call my dr who tells me to just go get checked thinking it‚Äôs nothing, but better safe than sorry. 

get to the hospital and checked in, monitored up, they do a few tests and they determine my water did break based on the liquid coming out when the dr told me to cough while he was 5 fingers deep in me ü•¥ the nurse comes in and says they‚Äôre gonna start me on pitocin and take me up to L&amp;D. word of advice, eat before you go to the hospital even if you‚Äôre 99.9% sure they‚Äôre gonna send you home or you‚Äôll be forced to beg and bride the nurses to let you eat! luckily, i got to eat before starting on pitocin. 

pitocin starts and i reach the max dosage and never got past 1cm, so on sunday morning they decided to try a foley balloon. inserting it did not hurt whatsoever compared to the vaginal exams they had to do to check mr cervix. what does hurt is when you stand up after getting it inserted and have the most intense contractions you‚Äôve ever felt and lose your bowels while simultaneously throwing all the while your husband is trying to hold you over the toilet. 

withstand those contractions for a bit and i‚Äôm told I can get an epidural bc i‚Äôm 5 cm! which bye, does NOT hurt. like at all. yay!!! now i‚Äôm feeling good. nurses are coming in and maneuvering my limp legs  into crazy positions to get labor moving. i‚Äôm thinking sunday is the day! i‚Äôm not progressing whatsoever though and a nurse discovers my water didn‚Äôt break, but rather a forebag or a really high leak they can‚Äôt see. during another check later on, it breaks! woohoo! 

I start going and dilating and the contractions are breaking through my epidural a little bit so they have to keep administering it. i‚Äôm realizing i‚Äôm only getting numb on one side and the other side maybe 25%. whatever I think..i‚Äôll be numb during labor!!!wrong‚Ä¶ nurse comes in as i‚Äôm screaming in pain and unable to get any more administered and says oh wow time to push! wtf?! no! i lose it saying someone better get me numb right now. fortunately, the anesthesiologist was an angel saint and allowed me one more dosage. I think she saw the crazed animalistic look in my eyes and knew I would rip that room apart if she didn‚Äôt do it. 

they start setting up and i‚Äôm patiently waiting for that lovely numb feeling that never comes. one leg was a floppy mess and the other slightly tingled. my vagina? could feel a draft from a mile away  it‚Äôs too late and it feels like I have to push. NOW. 45 min later, a beautiful baby girl ripped my vagina and entered the world! I ended up hemorrhaging and my husband said he‚Äôs never seen so much blood come out of a human. in all honesty, delivery was a piece of cake. it was hard don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it was the physical demands of delivering that made it hard. I really didn‚Äôt feel the pain bc I was so focused on pushing. 

unfortunately, I could feel the dr stitch me up so that sucked, but at that point my daughter was already on my chest so nothing really mattered at that point.

Well, my son finally arrived 40+3, I was 1cm and 80% effaced already from week 32 so doctors were predicting an early delivery. From week 32 to week 35 I was told to remain mostly resting with legs up. Then week 36 came and I was still 1cm dilated but I was 90% effaced. Doctors told me to get ready, he might come anytime now. Well my little dude made us wait the whole 40 weeks and 3 days. I went for a membrane sweep I couldn't bear been pregnant anymore. 

Well the membrane sweep worked perfectly. The day after I had it done I started having contractions. 

It started at 3am then by 4 the contractions were 7 mins apart I woke up took a shower and try to relax. By 7:00 we were in the hospital and they admitted me right away. Contractions were 3 mins apart and it stayed like that the whole freaking morning, at noon they decided to pop the amniotic sac. In the afternoon, I couldn't take it no more, I asked for the epidural. Anesthesiologist came in with the worse attitude ever, she was so rude to me, I started crying, the midwife was supporting me and trying to calm me down. Epidural didn't work!!! It gave me an hour of less pain, but I never felt numb and always felt some kind of pain. By 4 the contractions were so strong I was basically just yelling all the time. They couldn't give me another epidural. They got me some kind of gas to relieve the pain, it kinda help but it wasn't much I was ready to push but I was 8cm dilated and needed to wait until 10cm. They gave me something to stop the urge of pushing, it help a bit but I was just crying, grabbing my husband's t-shirt and twisting my body in complete agony. Then it was time to push and the pain got even worse, I think I might have pushed more than 30 times, baby wasn't coming out, the midwife asked if she was allowed to cut but I couldn't answer every sound coming out of me was in a form of yelling, my husband was my proxy so he said, do whatever is necessary to get him out faster. So she cut me... 

I swear to god, I thought it couldn't get worse, I felt the cold scissors against my skin and then I heard the snipped, I think I died there a bit. I felt the midwife's fingers getting inside to reach for my baby and finally I heard the crying. My son was born at 6:07 in the afternoon, after 11 of being admitted in the hospital. I was so confused, I was ready to embrace more pain and keep pushing my husband had to shake me to tell me the baby was out even tho I could hear him crying. Someone put a new pillow under my head and suddenly they put my baby on my chest, I was crying so much from pain I couldn't really acknowledge the baby, I saw my husband weeping stroking my head, he was talking but I don't know what he was saying. 

Then they helped me deliver the placenta, that wasn't so bad but down there I was so destroy that I just cried the whole time. 

A doctor came in to do the stitches, and oh boy... They apply local anesthesia but again, I felt everything! the needle coming in, the thread, the knot, the snip. I was in so much pain!!!!.... I got 7 stitches in total. 

I'm still recovering physically and mentally from childbirth, my son helps a lot, he's just so freaking cute!!! But I think I eventually will need therapy, since his birth I'm unable to see scissors and the sound triggers me so badly I just start weeping. 

I guess I'm sharing this here because this sub has always been there for every step of my pregnancy and I feel the need of closure. Writing down my experience is a good way for me to let it out and let it go.

So i decided to go for a walk (at 5 a.m.!) to calm down and to rock little one to sleep. Outside the building i couldn't hear the same noise as in my flat. It was nearly quiet. Or at least quiet enough, that no one would ever bother. But inside my flat and even the stairwell the bass was disturbing loud.
Now that i walked for an hour my lil one calmed down. But my stomach is still upset and my thought are going crazy. How could i ever say something against the noise, when it's not noticable outside? How did they installed their Sound System, that it worked out like this? We plan to live in this flat for at least another year before moving to a bigger one. To save money. How should this go on?

I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep from the combination of hormones and husband‚Äôs snoring, so I laid down in the living room. I woke up at 4am to my son asking if I could rest with him. So I went into his room for a little bit and came back out to the living room and laid down. Kind of dozed for a bit, but had to pee so I sat up. When I did, my water broke at 530 (on the new sofa). Puddled my way to the hall bathroom and I yelled to husband ‚ÄúI think my water just broke.‚Äù Keep in mind, at my last OB check, I was 7cm dilated and 80% effaced.

It was a mad but collected rush getting out of the house. My oldest was not easy to wake up and our middle little was not happy about the early wake up call. They were very concerned that we were ‚Äúgoing to get their sister‚Äù but the ‚Äúsun wasn‚Äôt awake yet.‚Äù They‚Äôre not allowed in the ward (covid), so my husband stayed in the lobby with them until our friend came and picked them up. 

I was using one of the GIANT postnatal pads I had left over from my second pregnancy, soaked through it, left a puddle in the car, left a puddle at the lobby reception, left a bit of a trail to the elevator, and left a puddle in triage as we were getting situated. My new birks are now christened. Don‚Äôt underestimate the amount of fluid you‚Äôre walking around with! 

Contractions were SUPER mild - I mean, like no worse than a moderate period cramp - and we‚Äôre about 10 minutes apart. Still at 7cm at this point. They stayed that way from 730 when we got to the delivery room until 11. I took a nap around 930 or 10, but woke up to STRONG contraction at 11 (as in, bed slapping, could not talk through them kind of strong) and they just didn‚Äôt stop after that. They were immediately painful and immediately 2 minutes apart. They checked and at that point I was 9cm. 

Anesthesiology was paged as they started the second round of penicillin (GSB+) and a second banana bag. They got to the room and gave me an intrathecal (HIGHLY recommend, but they‚Äôre only good for two hours. So if you can make it through the majority of contractions, go for it) at 1155. Best decision and they got there *just* in time. Unlike with unlike my oldest, I actually felt like I had the most control through the contractions sitting up on the edge of the bed instead of laying down. Chilled with the meds for about 30 minutes when my doctor came in and checked me. Little Miss was RIGHT there - like easily station +3 if not more - she stuck her hand in to check and said ‚Äúboop‚Äù when she touched her head.

Started pushing at 1240 and Little Miss was here at 1250. Took about 4 pushes and I barely had a 1st degree tear! She came out screaming and was nice and pink - got an 8 and 9 for her apgars. 

Apparently had a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù placenta and a super thick cord. We had two nurses - one was a traveling nurse and was on her second day of orientation - they were AMAZING. Way better than the others we‚Äôve had.

Born 7 lb 13 oz, 20.2 inches. 12 hours of labor, 1 hour pushing, first time mama!

My contractions started hard, sudden, and fast. There was no slow buildup, no small contractions that slowly got harder and more frequent. I got up to use the restroom yesterday morning and I notice the shape of my belly was just different - I was sticking our way further and very round, and I thought to myself ‚Äúhuh that‚Äôs weird.‚Äù Of course this extended shape meant I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable in back in bed, and after tossing and turning a bit, I thought maybe I pinched something in a bad way, because I got this sudden cramp. I thought it was more like a bowel movement, since those just kinda come on suddenly (yay constipation!). The time was 5:30 am. 

I went to the bathroom, cleared my bowels, and had two full contractions by the time my husband woke up, and was concerned as to why I was awake, but we both kinda brushed it off because I‚Äôve had plenty of real (not Braxton-Hicks) ones that ultimately haven‚Äôt led anywhere over the last few weeks. But he left for work, and I couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep still. They kept coming and coming and coming, and while I wasn‚Äôt screaming (yet) I was definitely groaning with each one. 

So I ran a nice hot bath, and I started counting them via app. It didn‚Äôt take long  at all (within 30 minutes, maybe) for the app to start telling me to ‚Äúget ready‚Äù to go to the hospital, and even quicker after that for it to tell me to get going. Because this was my first, and my water hadn‚Äôt broken, I told my husband not to hurry and like get a ticket or anything, but that he needed to come back home. By the time he got there, it was around 8:30 am and I was indeed screaming with each contraction.

We pulled into the hospital at just before 9:00 am. They unfortunately didn‚Äôt have a wheelchair for me (hospital has been PACKED lately) so while my husband parked I managed to walk to OB Emergency, occasionally leaning against the wall when a contraction rolled through. When I got registered, they hooked me up to IVs, vitals, and the machine that measures contractions. The cervical exam they did on me took me by surprise - I‚Äôve had nothing but pleasant experiences, but this one was PURE AGONY. Apparently my cervix was super far back under Cel‚Äôs head, and she was already pretty low, but we found out that I was already 5-6 cm dilated! 

An hour later I was in an L&amp;D room (actually I was lucky, I got the last one available), and I opted for an epidural. I wasn‚Äôt sure originally if I wanted one or to go natural, but 5 hours of that pain every 3 minutes was plenty enough for me. That part wasn‚Äôt exactly fun, but I‚Äôm a rather small person, so the spaces between my vertebrae aren‚Äôt very big either. But it did eventually go in and the relief was almost immediate. Totally, 100% worth it. Especially with 7 hours to go. 

A short while after, my OB came in to break my water, and we found out that Celeste had had a big giant bowel movement inside me. From there, I was just waiting, stretching my pelvis in different positions on the peanut ball while on a pitocin drip, getting a little bit of rest before the inevitable, because the sooner we got her out the better. My nurse worked with me though and compromised, letting her get as low as she possibly could - letting my body do things automatically. 

4:15 rolls around, and my nurse nods at me and asks me if I wanna have a baby. They get everything set up and I start pushing. We pushed in a couple different positions, with a few different techniques. They set up a mirror for me too, so I could see baby girl‚Äôs head getting closer and closer. Even with the epidural, this still hurt, in its own kinda way. Not ripping and tearing and wringing of my own body inside out, but instead an intense pressure, the biggest poop I‚Äôve ever made, and a big force of pressure behind my eyes. Plus, my body had been working all day even if I hadn‚Äôt felt it, so when I added my own effort to it, I REALLY felt how exhausted I was even at the start. However I am more than familiar with the concept of a hard work-out, and apparently I had great technique in pushing - all my nurses and doctors kept saying I was MADE for this (I‚Äôm choosing to take this in a positive way, like that labor is nothing I need to fear). For anyone else fearing actual labor, in the moment you don‚Äôt. The only way out is through, so it‚Äôs just something you do. I was terrified and literally trembling (partly because hormones and the epidural) but there‚Äôs just no time for that, ultimately. 

I pushed for slightly over an hour, and my OB made a small second degree cut along my perineum just so I wouldn‚Äôt tear roughly right at the end. With the epidural I didn‚Äôt feel a thing, nor did I feel the sutures afterwards. The moment that she came out‚Ä¶after so many months of increasing pressure on the inside for the last 9 months, the negative pressure I experienced was astounding. I just emptied out so much. But I had no time to focus on that because her cry‚Ä¶I couldn‚Äôt control it I was bawling. It was so strong and loud and beautiful and I had just given birth and I was just sobbing, so was my husband. But he got to cut the cord and head into the next room with the NICU team while they emptied Cel‚Äôs lungs of the bowel movement she inhaled. And then i got to hold her and she‚Äôs absolutely perfect. So perfect. 

So far the worst part is the soreness and the exhaustion. Be prepared to not rest even after delivery. Lots of People wanna come in and see baby, so they interrupt any nap you might take, plus if you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôll be so attuned to any noise that your LO makes. Celeste has been spitting up amniotic fluid and I‚Äôve been on high alert for that to help her out so what little sleep I‚Äôve gotten is not restful. 

But I‚Äôm happy. So so happy. My advice would be to move around as much as possible (and gently) to recover faster. this morning I couldn‚Äôt bear to sit normally, between the stitches and the soreness in my pelvic floor. But I relied on pain meds/local anesthesia (my nurses gave me a numbing spray and witch hazel wipes as well as the peri bottle) and I‚Äôve just moved around my room as much as I can or want to and I‚Äôm already so much better. 

There‚Äôs so much to learn about nursing and baby care and recovery care and everything that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard not to get overwhelmed, especially when you‚Äôre so tired already. But remember to rely on your partner, the nurses, your family, whoever you have and enjoy every step. Take pictures, pause and just smile at your little warriors. I‚Äôm in awe at what I can do now, that I took half a cell from myself and my husband and made this gorgeous little thing, and then pushed it out of my body. I feel so lucky and blessed.

I believe I‚Äôve also been feeling the notorious round ligament pain. Sharp pain in the lower pelvic region! I find I feel it when I‚Äôm changing positions, for instance getting up from a sitting/lying position to standing. Have you ladies felt that at those times too? 

I‚Äôm eager to hear what you ladies experienced during pregnancy for common aches and pains that are exclusive to pregnancy. I‚Äôm sure if I didn‚Äôt have the history of miscarriages or had a previous pregnancy to compare this to, I wouldn‚Äôt be so cautious.

I am 21yrs old and this is my first pregnancy. I found out I was pregnant June 5th and my due date is Feb. 16th. Today I am 12 weeks 3 days pregnant and so far this has already been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. At around 5 1/2-6 weeks I started getting extreme morning sickness. I couldn‚Äôt keep any food or liquids down I was throwing up at least 4-5 times a day and none of the meds the doctors prescribed me worked. Finally around July 9th they admitted me to the hospital with hypermesis and by this point I was down 20lbs. While in the hospital my husband unfortunately had to work which is about an 1 1/2 away from the hospital where we lived. So I was by myself most of this time which was super scary as my veins kept blowing from the iv potassium. They were talking about putting in a pic line because my veins were so hard to find. They finally had me on liquid zofran every 6 hours and an anti anxiety pill that helped get my appetite back and this combination seemed to help stop the vomiting. Finally after about 2 weeks I was able to keep solid food down but this is when I noticed that food didn‚Äôt taste good anymore. I had already noticed some things smelling almost bitter beforehand but now most things tasted bitter too. I‚Äôll come back to this in a second. Just recently I had an incident with my ob doctors office. They called me irresponsible for asking them to do the NIPT test. Multiple different RNs sent me messages telling me ‚Äúthis is a very costly test‚Äù and ‚Äúyou should really think about the costs of things since you will be a new mother‚Äù even though I already told them I checked with the insurance company who said the test would be fully covered for me. They proceeded to tell me that I am irresponsible for requesting this test as it should be reserved for older pregnant women and I could just do the other genetic test for Down syndrome. I told them that I wanted the NIPT not only to see the risk of down syndrome and trisomy 18 but also to find out the baby‚Äôs gender. They told me they will not order the test as they believe the risk is low and gender is an irresponsible reason to order the test. I just don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs such a big deal if my insurance company will cover it. As a first time mom I was outraged by the way they were talking to me it seemed like they saw me as a child and were talking down on me. Had this happened to anyone else? If so how did you handle it? Am I over reacting? It‚Äôs been super hard for me to handle all of these strong emotions and sometimes I feel super alone.  I don‚Äôt live near family and I also don‚Äôt know anyone else who is pregnant or even pregnant and my age. My husband tries to be there for me but there are some things he just doesn‚Äôt get. Back to the bitter taste. Not everything taste bitter like most fruit is tolerable and candy and things like caramel but things like peanut butter taste like cigarette smoke and most other foods have an undescribable bitter taste. Nothing I seem to do masks this taste even my toothpaste has a faint bitter taste it‚Äôs really difficult to get healthy food in me when it all taste so nasty. All I want is to be able to enjoy a meal again  The only thing I can eat as things like candy gummy‚Äòs fruit and I also can‚Äôt eat a full meal so I never really truly feel full. If I do find something that is tolerable I only can eat a couple bites before it starts to taste bitter. From the research I‚Äôve done it seems like this could go away after the first trimester but when I asked my doctor they had no clue what I was talking about. Has anyone else struggled with this bitter taste? If so when did it go away or what were some things you did to cope?

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this. Maybe to know if I‚Äôm not alone with this, maybe to vent? 

I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom pretty much since our 3 year old was born. I had a job for 9 months however since my husband works hard labor and I was a medical worker that got to be inside even though we both had full time jobs he felt he didn‚Äôt have to help with anything at home. Including dishes, laundry, kids baths or cleaning the house/pet care. That was up to me because his job was ‚Äúharder‚Äù and he earned more. After so long of working full time and handeling everything at home alone my health literally crashed. I was in the hospital with ulcers and was in so much pain I couldn‚Äôt lift my kids for a few months. I became a stay at home mom again. To lessen the stress. My husband earns enough so financially we were fine. 


Being a stay at home mom can be rough mentally. I love my kids more than anything. But I need a break‚Ä¶..My mom watches my son 2 hours a week and that‚Äôs about it. I haven‚Äôt gone on a trip for 3 years. My husband is a hunter and he goes on weekend trips every other month and sometimes it‚Äôs a week long while I‚Äôm alone with the kids. 

Earlier this year he went on a trip to the beach with his family for a weekend and then also told me he is taking his best friend on a bachelor trip the weekend of my birthday. I asked if he could book a trip for us because I need a break and would love some time with him. He said maybe. Well today we went to the zoo and our toddler threw a fit and he declared our trip was now canceled. I was devastated I had a baby sitter for the weekend I had a hotel in mind and activities to go together planned. I have been crying since and just tired. He left for another scout for a hunt for his best friend has in a week and I‚Äôm watching Mickey Mouse again on repeat. I asked if I could have some extra money to go do something for myself then and he said no. He will be gone on my birthday and for our anniversary we will have a newborn. We have major weddings coming up and there was really only one chance I had before baby. 

This triggered major depression for me and I am not sure how to handle how bad I‚Äôm feeling. I was already having a hard time emotionally with this pregnancy and now I feel worse.

Apologies for length, I‚Äôm not sure what tangents everyone would find helpful.

I have PCOS, and took three GD tests: passed early one hour, failed one hour after that was ordered after I was measuring a bit ahead, and a passed three hour, but because my two middle numbers were within 10 points of borderline my Ob wanted to be cautious and referred me to MFM for monitoring and diet control. 

At my appt last week, I was already over 2 cm dilated and my cervix was ‚Äúsoft‚Äù. I saw a different NP because my Ob had her baby last week (ü§©)on the day of my appt.

At 12:20 a.m. Monday morning, I woke up thinking I had to pee for the third time in two hours, only to feel what I thought was a kick, then feel a pop, and fluid rush out. 

I woke my husband up to tell him it was go time, called the nurse line and told them I felt cramps but more constant vs coming and going, not really painful. Lady told me to head on in, but I took a shower because I felt gross from the weekend, I figured it would be a while and my husband, bless his soul, was running around trying to throw everything in the car üòÇ. 

We got to the hospital about an hour after my water broke, and by that point, I was struggling a bit. The intake ladies were super nice, got me in a little room to monitor me and start the blood work, etc.

We were told I was over 3 cm dilated and that my BP was climbing. It had been slowing elevating over the past month or so, but my doctor/nurses never seemed overly concerned and blamed it on the stress/anxiety of baby‚Äôs estimated size (6 lbs 7 Oz at 33 weeks) and honestly the NP told me I a lot of scary things *would* happen because of my GD (that I did not have, salty still) that the MFM doctor had to calm me down from the anxiety attack and explain the actual risk level for me was basically non existent.

Anyway!

They get me to a room, my contractions already less than two minutes apart and lasting almost a minute, see that my BP is worse, give me some IV meds to help, give me some fentanyl to help with my pain, and start routinely checking my sugars. My BP soon hits the 180s so I was put on a magnesium drip. My labor progressed very quickly, I‚Äôm next on the list to get the epidural (which I was terrified of but felt it was better for my baby based on how little energy I was already at).

The poor nurses were harassing the poor anesthesiologist after his last patient took a while because they were worried I was going too fast and would miss out on it as I was 8 cm by 5 a.m. I was also struggling not to bear down now that the contractions were getting stronger. 

My husband was doing everything I asked, and was a wonderful support person. I felt so bad because he gave me his hand to squeeze instead of the bed rail and I said no. He said ‚ÄúI went through all this effort to not precast my hand for you-‚Äú and apparently I gave him a death glare because he stopped mid sentence and the nurse burst out laughing. Side note: the nurses were laughing at me because even mid contraction I would answer them with ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù and finish most contractions with ‚Äúfuck‚Äù. I was worried that I would be mean while in that much pain, turns out my sailor mouth just cranks out extra F and C words üòÇ

That wonderful doctor man came in, gave me the run down, and with the help of the nurses and my husband, I was able to sit still through the contractions and get the epidural in 20 minutes. I did have a few side effects from the meds and had to switch positions sometimes because the epidural would wear off of whatever side I wasn‚Äôt laying on. I did end up needing a small amount of insulin at one point, but it was only the one dose.

And then I stalled. It took about 5 hours for me to get the last two cm and lose the last bit of my cervix, the nurses had me use the peanut in several positions. I starting pushing around 1:30 p.m.,  and made good progress until the third hour started. Munchie wasn‚Äôt in distress or anything, but he wasn‚Äôt coming down like he should. Doc came in the check him and said he couldn‚Äôt wiggle him, and he was afraid to use forceps and get him stuck, but that I could keep pushing and see what would happen, and if not, we could discuss c section. 

I opted to keep trying until after three and a half hours, I was getting sick every few minutes and I was struggling to focus and push correctly. I was exhausted and afraid I would hurt my baby so my husband and I talked it over and went with the c section.

It is more of a blur after that, I remember being very cold and asking the anesthesiologist if I could have a blanket. He told me I probably just had the shakes from the meds, and my response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so cold, my nipples hurt‚Äù. He laughed, apologized, and got me a heated blanket. My husband sat with me and I tried not to listen to what was going on behind the curtain. I heard something about my bladder and compound hand, was told to look up, and there he was: my 7 lb, 11 oz, 21 inches of sweet, baby boy perfection. They has NICU staff check him over and then handed him to my husband while they put me back together. Turns out that Munchie had his hand up by his face and he wouldn‚Äôt have fit down the canal. He also had a bent leg from having his legs crossed so he was a bit bruised but it was back to normal very soon.

I was still having BP issues, so I got more meds and was in post op for at least an extra hour. I didn‚Äôt mind as at that point, I had my baby on my chest and just wanted to eat. They finally got my BP to start going down and get stable, if still a bit high, and the doc cleared me for a full diet (man was my hero). 

I was in the hospital until Thursday due to my BP, but they said it was stable enough to finally send me home.

I didn‚Äôt get a lot of rest, due to the extra monitoring of us both and attempting to breastfeed, and my hormones have me crying a lot. I‚Äôm planning on talking to my doc about it, as when my baby starts to cry and won‚Äôt stop, I tend to follow suit.

We‚Äôre getting a routine down and my milk is coming in pretty well I think.

I experienced a traumatic event in my early 20s. I am the type of person that internalizes rather than externalizes. This was seen as anxiety that developed into blackouts, mild self harm, a 6 month period of binge drinking, disassociation to name a few. The last 3 years I felt I was doing much better and overcame the ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù coping mechanisms. However, my anxiety went straight to my gut, stomach, pelvic floor.

I am 16 weeks, due date Jan 21. At my appointment Wednesday, I had an anal ultrasound. My rectum is an inch lower than in a normal pregnant person. She said we will be doing a c section.

I got to a pelvic physical therapist weekly. At first I thought this was happening because my rectal muscles must be week however it is quite the opposite.

It‚Äôs not common or widely known, but it does happen. It worries me that I can somehow hurt my baby. I have spoken to my doctor about this and while they try to say it kindly the answer is essentially ‚Äúyour baby can feel anything that is going on in your body‚Äù. Aka, yes this impacts your baby. I dont actively feel stressed or anxious because my mind/body has been so well trained to hide it within.

Yesterday I had my first appointment with my obgyn and talked to him about having a c-section and I explained it to him why. I he said he understands and he will support me on my decision and we can talk about it later. 
Why c-section is seen as bad thing here in the states? How was your experience? Natural and c-section? To be honest with you guys I never imagined myself having natural birth bc of silly stories I heard like: 
Your sexual life won‚Äôt be same 
You will pee on your pants if you sneeze or jump 
If you get stitches it will be very painful for a long time 
The baby can get stuck and you will need a  c-section anyway 
And much more. 
Yes, this scares me much more than a c-section recovery (I had other major surgeries before)

I‚Äôm really struggling through my 2nd pregnancy. My first one was at 19 years old and I gave birth at 20. Now I‚Äôm 25 and it seems like pregnancy has been cruel to me; I even contemplated getting an abortion because it was so bad and I feel like it‚Äôs breaking me and my partner apart but I‚Äôm religious and couldn‚Äôt live with myself if I just eliminated something I practically begged God for. 

Some days I feel like I‚Äôm losing my sanity, I feel like my mind leaves my body and I mentally cannot do this. The thing is, I‚Äôve done pregnancy before but not THIS kind of pregnancy. I‚Äôm not used to being in physical pain every single day for months at a time, I‚Äôve never been through any kind of chronic pain like that before. I truly did not expect it when I decided to try for a baby. My first pregnancy I had a rough 1st trimester but I was still able to sleep through the night and my body didn‚Äôt ache me, I was just tired. This time I‚Äôm dealing with:

-Body aches
-High levels of nausea 
-constipation(which I found out RECENTLY, my anti-nausea medication has this as a SIDE EFFECT. Wtf obgyn. Why solve one issue just to give me another one?) 
-GAS PAINS. I get gas every night and they aren‚Äôt funny farts, my stomach is stretched to it‚Äôs max and I can‚Äôt even sleep. It‚Äôs so painful, I have get out of bed and stretch to try &amp; relieve it. At 3am. Every night.
-acid reflux 


All before 20 weeks. I‚Äôm 10 weeks and 3 days. I still have some ways to go before I‚Äôm even out of the first trimester. How do I cope mentally? Everyday I feel less human like my sanity is slipping. This is coming from someone with ptsd from a previous abusive relationship, and who previously had depression and dealt with self harm and suicide attempts. My mental health has not always been perfect but the last two years have been my best years: I haven‚Äôt harmed myself or thought of hurting myself and I love life.

Not so much right now. Some days I‚Äôm so immobilized by the pain I can‚Äôt even leave my bed.

I gave birth in 14 minutes. Oh and almost had a highway baby!

This is going to be a long story. 

It started st my 36 week checkup when my dr wanted me to see a specialist. The specialist scheduled me for an i duction on July 27th when I would be 38 weeks; also she did a membrane sweep. As this was my second baby I knew things could happen faster and my first was born 3 days after my sweep at 37 weeks on the day. We live 2 hours from rhe hospital so we had decided to have my mom come stay with our toddler and pets after my sweep and my husband and I would stay at the hotel a few minutes away from the hospital.

The day after my sweep I was having contractions all day but they were not very intense. My husband and I decided to head to the hotel anyway. As my mom also lives hours away we met her at the hotel and we all went out for lunch, which was lovely. Mom took our toddler and they heades back to our home. My husband and I checked into the hotel and had a nap. I was waiting for the contractions to get really bad as I did not want to be the woman who gets sent home. The next morning we went to the hospital and guess what. I was sent home! The machine wasn't picking up the contractions strong enough. So we drove the 2 hours back home.

Feeling discouraged and exhausted from the contractions that I was 100% feeling I moped around the house. Still have contractions 2 days later we went back to the hotel. Again I wanted them to be intense so that I would.not get sent home again. So we curb walked and walked some more. Finally the contraction were stopping me. So we headed to the hospital ready to have a baby. SENT HOME AGAIN! This time told.that I was dehydrated, I was given and IV of fluid and gravol.

Now I was upset. I was so ready to met my baby, to not be in pain anymore. This was Sunday that all of this happened. Home agIn and I was a mess. On Monday I was still upset, discouraged and uncomfortable but I had no contractions all day which was discouraging on another level. Monday evening I went to bed early and took a gravol (approved by my provider). 

I woke up at 3am for a snack and a glass of milk. Back to bed I went. At 4am my water broke waking me up. I told my husband 'I think my water just broke"" he jumped out of bed very quickly. My husband looks at me like I am Crazy as I start sniffing the sheets, I needed to be sure that I didn't just pee the bed. I am not having any contractions so we decide that we have time and take a shower. I also tried on 3 different dresses before deciding which to wear. I call L&amp;D amd tell the nurse that I think my water broke. She remembers me from Sunday and tellse to come in to get checked. 

The contractions started at about 5am so we got into the car amd headed out. 30 minutes later amd they were 5 minutes apart. Another 20 minutes and they were less than 2 minutes apart. My husband is freaking out! Knowing that only one of us can be panicking I stay calm. I keep telling him that it ia fine, we will make it to the hospital no problem. While in my head I am thinking ""oh dear god thia baby is coming any minute!"" 

We make it to the hospital and my husband drops me off at the front door so he can park the car. Once inside the hospital there are 3 ladies there. 2 for registration and 2 for covid screening questions.  I walk past them all while they are talking to me. The registration lady is following me down the hall telling me I have to register, I say ""No"" and keep going. Once in the L&amp;D ward I stop to ring the bell for service. I am taken into a birthing room and told to leave my pad on the sink to be tested. I am helped onto the bed and my husband shows up. At this point I am in PAIN! 

Nurses check me and tell me that I can not push yet as I still have a little cervix. My body disagreed and it pushes. Again I told not to push, to breathe through it. That was very difficult but I did it! 

The doctor arrives and I can push now! I start pushing but it hurts and I can not seem to focus. I ask for help, a nurse and my husband hold my legs for me and I focus on my husband's watch. I can feel the baby crowning, he will be here soon! Suddenly the doctor tells me.""little pushes so that you don't tear"" (I would later find out this was a lie) how in the world do you do little pushes? So I didn't push actively, I just let my body do it's thing. My husband has tears in his eyes and I feel so in love with him. After a moment or two the doctor tells me that I can push big again. I do and baby comes out like a waterslide, literally all of my excess amniotic fluid makes a large splash! 

My baby boy was here. He weighted 9lbs exactly and was born at 37 weeks on the day.
I asked the dr if I tore, yes I did. 
My husband later tells me why the dr was telling me little.pushes and why he had tears in his eyes. Our baby boy was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. Wrapped so tightly that the dr could not get her fingers under it to losen it. His whole head was blueberry blue and his body blood red. Big pushes that progressed his decent were hanging him.

Also the most exhausted üòÇ there‚Äôs something so incredibly special about this very moment. 

Showed up for induction Thursday afternoon and got started on Cervidil. Started having fairly regular contractions, but cervix only went from close to maybe 1 cm. The contractions got incredibly painful and the nurses were worried I was going into active labor, so they pulled out the Cervidil and I was able to sleep for a few hours. 

Pitocin started Friday morning at 4am. Contractions started off manageable and they titrated the pitocin decently quickly. The doctors came at like 7ish to check me and I was at 1cm. He did break my water. The contractions after that were unbearable painful and I opted to get an epidural, which was placed pretty quickly. Continued titrations the drip up and went from 1 to 4 cm in like an hour. By 11am check I was at 6cm! We thought we‚Äôd meet our boy by early afternoon. Instead, I failed to progress any more after that. He was super far down and was causing my cervix to swell instead of dilate. So at 4pm, at our doctors advice decided a C-section was the safest way to go. I got prepped and ready and my husband was able to sit in the operating room with me. I was very out of it as my blood pressure dropped in the middle, but I vaguely remember him being there and being shown the baby when he came out.

Now I‚Äôm 10 hours post op and am mildly frustrated that I can‚Äôt get up and move around and just generally that things didn‚Äôt go according to plan. However holding my sagely delivered baby boy makes up for all of that.

I was diagnosed with GDM at 30 wks and really struggled with the diet due to incorrect information given by the dietician I was given. I lost 13 lbs during my pregnancy.  I was put on Metformin to help but found out I was allergic and then given small doses of insulin to help with my fasting numbers which were always just a tad high. I was given NSTs twice every week - in which my little boy would pass with flying colors well before the required time. While I loved all the OB's at my hospital, almost every single person I met, in every office visit pressured me to schedule an induction. One nurse (ironically enough, during a NST) suggested I better get over my fear of induction because if I didn't induce, my baby would be stillborn. I gave in and just scheduled an ""out-patient"" induction. This entails 2 rounds of a pill called Misoprostol once every two hours to ""ripen"" my cervix. You see, by my due date (7/26), I was effaced 90% but not dilated at all. They said they could not give me Pitocin until I was dilated and this ""Miso"" would help get me there. Those first two days, I would take the pill orally and then be monitored for 2 hrs and then sent home to see if my water would break. Well, each night I would sit there for two hours and have steady, small, manageable contractions and they would usually stop after about 4 hours. 

On the morning of the third day, I went in for my actual induction at 9:30a since nothing had come from the cervical ripening. I was a little scared but mostly excited to see my son soon! My sister had just had her baby via induction (her first, but they waited until 41 weeks) and told me Pitocin was nothing to be nervous about and she was really pumping me up! We got checked in, up to our room, they came in to put an IV in me and this is when I guess shit started going downhill - I just didn't know it yet. I was apparently a little dehydrated. The poor nurses kept injecting numbing agents into my veins to place the IV but my veins kept rolling. They tried 5 times before they had to call in a specialist. She eventually had to just shove the needle in (w/o numbing) which was probably the most painful needle I've ever experienced and got my fluids going. It's been 9 days since and my arms and hands are still covered in bruises from the IV hunt. Then - once that debacle was over around 2 pm- the Misoprostol was given to me vaginally. This was horrendous. Gloved hand, no lube (because the pill needed to stick), and shoved straight up into my cervix. I was then told that I would be given Miso this way every 4 hours up to 6 doses. THAT'S 20 HOURS - I thought to myself!! And the nurses kind of apologized and assured me that it doesn't usually take that many doses but to get prepared to be here a while (!?!?). So I chilled, my husband and I walked around the L&amp;D floor, I bounced on my ball, I watch so many episodes of Friends and then they came in to give me a second dose around 6:30p. Still had pretty manageable contractions but could walk and talk through them. They came back in with the doctor for the 3rd dose at 11p and THIS is the first time someone checked my fucking cervix. I was dilated to a 3. Ok, I thought, that's progress right? No. Not enough for Pitocin, we have to keep doing this Miso shit. 

Flash forward to about 4a and I am having actual, take your breath away contractions, breathing and focusing; but in the back of my mind I'm like ""fuck, if I'm still at 3 cm and I've got to get to 10 and it's been 19 hrs - there is no way I'm going to have the strength to get through this"". I look at my husband and admit that although I've been dead set on having an all natural, drug-free birth, I'n going to need something to take the edge off so I can get a little rest before the big moment. He absolutely supports me and goes to get the nurse to give me some Fentanyl. Well, as AWESOME as that makes you feel, the contractions still kept me up. So I would sleep for about 10 mins and then wake up and have a crazy strong contraction and then fall back asleep. The dose is only enough to get through 1 hr so I maybe slept for 30 mins. 6am rolls around and my OB comes in to check on me and I feel like I am literally dying. My oxygen is low so they put me on O2 and check me again. Still ONLY dilated to 3 cm. I immediately was so hopeless and defeated. I was having what felt like 3 contractions back to back: 2 small ones that I could breathe through and 1 that was the worst pain in my life. I also felt as though I was going into shock. I was freezing cold and my body was shaking uncontrollably. The OB then noticed that every time I had a contraction, my baby's heart rate would plummet. He was in distress and I was not doing well. She broke my water around 8a and there was evidence that my son had had a bowel movement inside the womb. She was worried that his cord was wrapped around his neck and that was the source of his irregular heartbeat. My poor husband held my hand as she told us that we needed to get an epidural because I was in too much pain, too soon and it looked even more likely that we were going to have to have an emergency c-section. We were all so scared, my husband knew that I 100% did not want an epidural and was very adamant about not having a c section. I agreed to get a walking epidural and from then on everything went 1000x faster. It took them forever to get my epidural placed which was not fun; but once it was in, the pain was so much better. My son's heart was still in distress and the OB came in not 30 mins after the epidural was placed and told me we had to have the c section because nothing was getting better. This is when I gave in completely.. I knew that I had come this far to see my son and I would do anything to get him out alive and safe. My husband stood next to me with tears in his eyes, trying to be so supportive as about 15 drs/nurses rushed around me to get me prepped for the OR. Then just 20 mins later at 12:10p, William was placed in my arms and nothing in the world has ever mattered until that moment. He's perfectly healthy, the sweetest baby, and passed all of his tests. We're absolutely in love with him.

I share this stupid long story here to help any FTM like myself (I see you at 35 weeks, just searching ""graduation story"" to read others' experiences and prepare yourself mentally) and say ""thank you"" to all of those people who said to write a birth plan and then throw it TF away. They were so, so right. You don't know how anything is going to go down in there but what you do know is that you love this baby and when it comes down to it - you'll do whatever you need to, LITERALLY WHATEVER to see/hold/kiss your little one. 

While my birth was traumatic in the moment, and I won't say I haven't had a few cries regarding the failure of my original birth plan. I even said I would never have another child because this was such an awful experience. It's been 9 days and I've had time to process what's happened. I've been recovering well and seem to be bouncing back better than I first expected (not that those first few days weren't really, reaaaaallly hard) and I think my next birth plan will be a scheduled c-section to just cut out the bullshit.

I know it works differently in each country/state/province (I'm in Ontario btw) but the fact that at 11w2d I still haven't had a pelvic ultrasound is starting to make me anxious.

I do feel like everything is going well. I have pretty much every symptom related to development and increase in hormones. I can feel my uterus is stretching. Despite my prescription, I still have nausea and some vomiting (though much better). Everything that is supposed to happen to my nipples and breasts is happening. I can even start to see the faint line on my stomach! I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but my mum could see it too.

The closest I came was an abdominal ultrasound last week. They had to check my bladder and urinary tract so they saw my uterus. Because it wasn't the reason for the ultrasound they wouldn't let me see the images or even comment on it. They did see something related to my chronic condition so I got the report in my hospital chart within the hour but all I got was ""There is a live intrauterine pregnancy. There is a sac next to this pregnancy which appears to be empty?"" Which thanks to the internet and you lovelies I now know it was a vanishing twin. But that's it.

she she did me a membrane sweep.

during the day I had no cramps, no bleeding. After 12 hours.

I asked the midwife if there is anything I can do at home to help start labor and she told me semen doesn't really help because it would take ounces (lol). 

what can help is an orgasm but ... girls, I have one most days and so far it has never helped. maybe now with the membrane sweep it could? 
but I don't have much confidence.

she suggested nipple stimulation but I don't have a breast pump and I don't want like doing it manually, I'd rather taking the stairs (no, I'm kidding, instead of taking the stairs I prefer to give birth at 45 weeks, lol again).

I'm 33w. My husband and I bought and moved into our home about two weeks ago. Life has, understandably, been kind of hectic, and though we live comfortably enough to not worry much about money we did blow through quite a bit of our savings. Repairs, painting, whatever we needed to start our lives here. We definitely have the means to support ourselves and a baby, but can't be extravagant for a bit. Whatever. It's not hurting our feelings.


My husband, MIL, and I began talking about a baby shower when we began the process of buying our home. I made it clear to my MIL that if she wanted a formal party it would be mostly on her; my mom is totally broke, and we would have several financial obligations not allowing for much. She didn't mind at all. I gave her a few dates, told her I wanted it to be co-ed, and let her be. 


About a month passes and she's made absolutely no progress. I absolutely hate how behind it all feels, considering it's already a bit into June by now, but I don't say a word. Then we hear she's being evicted and essentially broke between paying past due rent and finding a new place. She got needlessly angry with my husband more than once and we both reached the point we were over her attitude. We both agreed there was no way she was planning a baby shower given her financial state... not to mention I hadn't really wanted one in the first place; I'm awkward, I hate being the center of attention, and the majority of my friends and family live out of state.


I let my husband tell her we had decided not to have one. According to him, she bawled like a baby and insisted we had to have one, even if my husband and I rented out a small space in a restaurant and did it over dinner. I felt horribly guilty and cried for days about it. I gave up and said we'd have one, even if it meant sacrificing $300+ for maybe 10 people.


Unsurprisingly, I couldn't find anything on such short notice considering I had to accommodate for about six different work schedules and a few older guests. Even tables at our local parks were booked. I gave up. I kept crying about it. 


When we heard back about final loan approval for our mortgage in early July, we let my MIL know we would have a small gathering at our new home on the first weekend of August. I kept the guest list super minimal (our parents, siblings, and one friend). She decided to assume responsibility for letting my husband's side of the family know while I took care of mine. Of course, all of this is a month in advance so silly me assumed people would know.


Our fake baby shower is tomorrow.


Our friend planned to come, but caught the delta variant. I'm not mad about it at all. He can't anticipate that. BIL#1 and his wife will be out of town. I'm a little angry, but they never show up for anything (but will absolutely throw a fit if you don't show up to their events). BIL#2 and his girlfriend might come. Might. My brother and his wife haven't answered. My FIL is being a child over absolute nonsense and is refusing to talk to my husband, so of course he won't show (which is fine, because he and MIL are divorced and he always acts out when she's around).


But my mom and MIL will be here.


So last night I cried, again. Because I'm tired of us continually making efforts to be part of people's lives when they can't return the favor. I genuinely don't care if people show up with gifts. I don't care if they look at the registry. I'm starting to feel like we don't matter, and that my feelings don't matter because literally all of this could have been avoided if I wasn't guilted into planning a shower I didn't want.


I just want a little respect for what I want. I'm exhausted. I'm in pain. I don't have patience left. This is our baby, not anyone else's.

Elated, we scheduled our first appointments, at which point we learned that the baby was small, and a more accurate estimated delivery date would be September 19th. We had been temping, so we were pretty confident about ovulation and conception dates, but we‚Äôre not professionals. We figured, must‚Äôve been off by a few days, no biggie.

Fast forward to our 20 week ultrasound, where we learn that the baby is right at the 10%ile overall. At that point, doctors were concerned about a possible marginal cord insertion. Despite this, they wanted us to wait and come back in four weeks for an additional growth scan; it was totally possible that all was well. (In later scans, better imaging would reveal that the cord is not in fact marginally inserted.) 

By 24 weeks, we had convinced ourselves that everything would be ok, despite taking in a lot of scary information from the internet. At this ultrasound, we got the devastating news that she was in the first percentile overall. An amnio was performed on the spot. Two weeks of waiting for those results, which ultimately showed that there were no known genetic factors at play nor infection. 

During this time, we sought out a second opinion, not out of distrust for our medical professionals; rather, we were just desperate for as much information as we could gather. This second MFM suggested that there might be a possibility that the altitude was affecting the placenta‚Äôs performance. (We live in Denver.) We asked if moving down in altitude might help, which she suggested it might. Three days later we had an appointment with MFM specialists in Chicago and were in the car, ready to summer with my in-laws. 

We have since spent 8 weeks here in Chicago, receiving weekly NSTs and fluid checks, as well as bi-weekly growth scans. Her initial scan here in Chicago placed her in the 23%ile. (Great, we thought! It was working.) Subsequent scans placed her in the 19th%ile. Then the 14th%ile. And yesterday, less than the 10%ile. In the last two weeks, she has only gained 106 grams. Again, we are totally devastated.

I keep seeking out some information from the doctor about what this growth pattern or our circumstances indicate to her. She insists that we may never know, but she is hopeful that the pathology of the placenta will give us some information. I keep reading stories hoping for some insight that my baby will be ok. But what if she is not? What if she has cerebral palsy or some other disability? What if she is tiny or sick when born and I don‚Äôt get to hold her? What if everything is fine and I did her more harm with all of this worry?

Beyond all of these serious and real concerns, there is also the issue of a baby shower. We are first time parents, and would benefit from the generosity of our friends and family. But I just cannot bring myself to celebrate given the circumstances.

They have seen the 4 chambers of the heart &amp; the septum (the dividing wall between the left and right side). They've said everything looks good.

Should I be worried something else is going on? I should've asked the OB nurse but was just overwhelmed with getting a call when they said they'd only call if something was wrong. She didn't say anything was wrong, basically just that they need the pictures and the regular US isn't getting them.

My husband and I are starting to consider our birth plan and the more we discuss it the more I'm leaning towards asking for an elective cesarean delivery. I know this can be a controversial subject but here is my list of reasons:

1. The birth of my daughter was very traumatic because I was not progressing fast enough and by the time I started pushing she got really stressed out and everyone was frantic about getting her out. She had some breathing trouble afterwards because of this, but luckily she recovered quickly. If c-sections are the route they go if something goes wrong why not be proactive and prevent the chance for similar issues to arise? 

2. I was in a severe accident two years ago that broke my back and led to serious injuries that left me in the ICU so I have terrible anxiety when it comes to the hospital. I also have a lot of lingering back problems. Planning ahead of time what's going to happen and having it done in a controlled environment can lift some of that anxiety. 

3. I have HSV and if I have an active recurrence when I go into labor I'll have to have a cesarean anyway. 

4. I have pelvic floor issues already that cause me pain and a bladder prolapse that already interferes with my life. I'm worried that a vaginal delivery will exacerbate these problems. 

5. We've met out out of pocket max this year and our insurance will cover any form of delivery 100% including an elective c-section. Being able to plan this will ensure the baby can be delivered this year (once she is 39 weeks of course)

6. Her due date is Jan 5th and I'm expected to resume nursing school in person on Jan 10th. Planning it with give me time to recover and bond with her before I have to return to school. 

So those are my reasons now here are my questions for those who have had a c-section: how do they sedate/numb you, did you feel faint at all during the procedure, how long did it last, were your partners able to be with you, were you able to hold your baby and do skin to skin immediately, how was your recovery, what pain management options did you have, how long until you were able to get up and walk, and did you feel like it was the safest option for you and the baby?",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,92097,public,self,Advice needed- Considering an elective cesarean,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/oz8umt/advice_needed_considering_an_elective_cesarean/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

This has put us in a really hard place financially and is putting us back a few months. I now have no savings at all. I told my partner she really needs to get a job to help out financially and she is mad. 

She doesn‚Äôt think  it‚Äôs fair my job lets me work remotely and she ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be able to stay home and work‚Äù I told her she could try to find a job that is remote but she said she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want a job like mine‚Äù. (I work in advertising and sales.) I am 6 weeks pregnant and stressed about money. We have our kiddos bday coming up, holidays and this baby due in March and I do not know how we will do it on my income alone given we are so put back with no savings now. 

My partner does not want to work and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt afford baby stuff and pay the bills and the with the holidays coming up. There‚Äôs just no way.

My boyfriend told me to come on here to hopefully find some peace of mind during these scary scary times for me. At 6wk3d I had a trans vaginal ultrasound and was told that nothing was found in my uterus and the cramping in my right side could mean an ectopic pregnancy. I go to the ER same day and my hcg levels are at 400 so they explained that I could just be early. They spotted a corpus luteal cyst on my right side though so I wonder if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing the cramping? I‚Äôve been having this pain, which I would describe as a very dull but consistent (it becomes sharp if I move/twist weird) menstrual cramp for about 2 weeks so began when I was about 4wk pregnant. I went to the OBGYN 2 days after to get blood work and another ultrasound. I should be getting back my results but she said even if my numbers did double I probably wouldn‚Äôt see anything. 
My symptoms right now are having a twinge sometimes on my right side but usually just a dull ache. I‚Äôm pretty gassy right now but I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs because I had ice cream before bed or it‚Äôs a symptom of my potential ectopic. 
My question to you guys is - If you‚Äôve ever had an ectopic pregnancy 
1. What were your symptoms? 
2. At what hcg level was your ectopic caught in an US? 
3. When did yours rupture if it did? 
4. If they don‚Äôt see an ectopic in an ultrasound, are you still at risk of having it rupture since it‚Äôs too small to even catch?

I apologize.


Wednesday 7/28 was my 3 year wedding anniversary. Between moving and medical school applications and work and my husband being promoted and (of course) learning all we could about pregnancy, neither of us realized that when we scheduled our 12 week appointment for that morning. I just happened to hand the morning off.


So we went to breakfast and reminisced about the last 3 years and pondered how different our lives would be on our next anniversary. Then we headed to our appointment. I love my OB. We're very similar and she's very personable and open. We chatted about expectations and birth plans and symptoms (mine had significantly improved over the past few weeks).


Then we got down to business. Full exam, everything looks great and feels like it's where it's supposed to be. Until the doppler. After an agonizing amount of time, my OB gave up. She said we weren't panicking, but we should do a quick ultrasound, since baby seems to be hiding.


You can tell by the title of this post, baby was not hiding. There were no fetal heart tones. Baby had stopped growing at 11 weeks and 1 day; 8 days previously. I work in the medical field. I knew what the lack of red and blue and measuring behind meant.


I don't think there are words to describe how I felt, sitting in the exam room waiting for my OB to come back and tell me what we already knew. The escapist in me kept wanting to believe she would come in and tell me there was a mistake. Or maybe take me back to the ultrasound so she could try instead. But I knew that wasn't happening.


We discussed options. We were right at the edge of where she would recommend a D&amp;C outright. But given risks to fertility, we were reluctant. We tried 8 months for this baby. In the end, we went home with an appointment for a week later and the hopes things would progress naturally. Leaving the clinic was the hardest part. That felt like I was accepting it, like I was leaving something behind.


At home, we cried. A lot. Then we discussed things. I was afraid to take the medication. The irrational me felt like that was me making the decision, even though I knew that it was already out of my hands. But after spend all that day and part of the next crying and struggling to really accept what was happening, I knew I couldn't move on until this was over.


On 7/29 we contacted my OB who sent in the prescription. After a fair amount of procrastination, I took it. An hour later, I experienced minor cramping, took some ibuprofen and I was fine. Or so I thought.


 Around 5 hours after taking the medication, I felt the cramping coming back, along with a severe sense of panic. I tried to ignore it, to find some relief by going to the bathroom. I ended up lying on the bathroom floor, unable to call out or find a comfortable position because of pain. 


Eventually, my husband got concerned and came to check on me. He heard me vomiting through the door and came in. Bless that man for having to deal with how unreasonable and stubborn that irrational part of me is. He put his foot down and off we went to the ER with me yelling, crying, and vomiting the entire way.


2 hours in the waiting room, morphine, 20 minutes of debriding, a transabdominal ultrasound, and a vagina ultrasound later and I was feeling better. Again, we discussed D&amp;C versus waiting and followup. I wasn't willing to take the medication again and my OB agreed. With my pain controlled and bleeding manageable, she said we could wait if we wanted or she would come in (at 3am) for the surgery. I still opted to wait. Maybe the worst was over.


We arrived home at 6am watching the world wake up around us. We sat in the car and cried. Then slept until 2pm, followed by a 3 hour nap at 4. Saturday and Sunday were relatively uneventful. I did have a bit more cramping Sunday, but ibuprofen, tylenol, and a heating pad seemed to be working. My husband insisted I take my temp, but it was normal right up to when we went to bed at 10.


At 12:30, he was woken up by me shaking. He moved quickly, waking me up, asking if I was OK. I said I was cold. I'm always cold. But to his touch, I was warm. So he took my temp and I had a fever. After many tears and slow movements (sleeping irrational me is even more difficult), we were off to the ER again. 


I had fever, chills, headache, and nausea. Having worked in the ER for 3 years, rational me was scared. I was certain I was septic. But overall what rational or irrational me thought or felt didn't matter much as things progressed quickly. As chance would have it, the same ER doc was on that night, so she knew what was happening. It wasn't long before I was on IV antibiotics and heading back to ultrasound. I drifted in and out of consciousness over the next several hours. My temperature hit 103.2 at one point, although we're not sure that was the peak.


A lot of unfortunate things happened over the 11 hours we were in the ER. Really, have continued to happen since then. But the mistakes of Healthcare workers is not the topic of this post, so I will gloss over that now. But suffice it to say, there were several. I thank God my husband was there keeping track and watching over me.


Did I mention my OB went on vacation starting Friday? Until the following Wednesday? No? Well, it's true. So instead of her, I got another doc from the same clinic whom I had met before. He's nice and experienced. But there's something old school that doesn't jive with me. I had honestly predicted he would be the one they would call. 


I was still pretty out of it when he came, but the summary was he wanted to avoid surgery with this active infection as it would cause increased risk to fertility. Instead, I was admitted to continue IV antibiotics every 6 hours. Infectious disease was roped in to treat my bacteremia. Thankfully, the antibiotics were working and my fever went away Monday around 11am and hasn't come back. Unfortunately, I have to stay until blood cultures show the infection has left my blood stream. They were last collected Tuesday morning. So tomorrow (I guess later today now) is the day, fingers crossed.


My OB came back Wednesday with a whirlwind of relief and let's get this sh*t done attitude. She apologized profusely. She assured me we were going to end this so we could move on. I was headed to pre-op at noon. At 2:00 I was out and awake. Honestly, I felt so much better. 


It was like flicking a switch. I got up today and used washcloths and soap to try and clean myself. I put on real clothes. We walked the unit for the first time. I crashed hard and took a 2 hour nap after that riveting experience. ID told us she is optimistic that the cultures will be clear and I'll be able to leave in oral antibiotics tomorrow. My OB told us surgery went perfectly. I had no pain or discomfort following the procedure and I've barely blead enough to fill a water bottle cap all day today.


So I should be feeling great and optimistic. I'm almost at the end of the road. Things are finally going right.


But instead, here I am, alone in a hospital room for the 4th night in a row. I miss my husband. He's here during the day, but can't stay the night (thanks covid). This is the most I've slept alone in the last 6 or so years and I miss the security of falling asleep in his arms. I miss my home. I miss my family.


But mostly, I miss my baby. Now that the medical concerns have slowed down, I can't stop thinking about it and all the things I will never know about them. I'll never know what color their hair and eyes were. I'll never know what their laugh would sound like or what it feels like to rock them to sleep. We had just started getting used to the idea of our pregnancy being real and now it's gone. And this huge change in our lives is just...not happening. This life that was literally inside me is now gone. I've never been this alone.


I don't know why I typed this all out. I know it got really long. I guess I just need to put it out there to the world, even if it falls on deaf ears. This sucks. This whole thing just sucks.


I do want to say, don't let my story scare you away from pregnancy or worry you if you are pregnant. Miscarriage is common (1in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage) and I think that's a fact that should be well known to everyone and not treated as taboo. However, things being as severe as it was for me is not common. My OB said that this is the most amount of complications due to miscarriage she has seen in her career. She has never had a patient go septic before. So the odds you end up goung through my particular flavor of 10 days of hell is very unlikely.

Camisoles: I still wear them every single day. I have the ones from Walmart with the breast support that I pulled the padding out of. It‚Äôs so easy to just whip a boob out in these and they‚Äôre supper comfortable while still offering some support. You can also wear them under nicer shirts if you‚Äôre feeling ‚ú®fancy‚ú® I also recommend a breast pumping bra if you end up wanting to or are able to breastfeed but that‚Äôs something you may want to look into later on. 

2. Bottle sterilizer: I had it in my head that I would just bOiL tHe BottLEs LiKE mY PaReNts uSeD tO. No. Don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm sterilizing bottles and breast pump parts 2x a day everyday to sit there and boil them, watch the stove, then lay them out to dry, and make sure they‚Äôre protected from the dust and dog hair flying around is annoying af. It‚Äôs worth it and you will use it. 

3. A Playmat: I personally have the Lovevery one which is a little pricey but I put it on my registry and my in laws got it for us and it is literally my favorite thing on this planet. We didn‚Äôt start using it until he was about 3-4 weeks old but it has quickly become his favorite place in the house. I always thought at this age babies just needed to eat, sleep, be changed and get cuddles to survive but man was I wrong. One night when I gave my son everything I could think of and he was still screaming in my face I thought ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go on your playmat‚Äù and he turned into a different baby. It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that babies get bored too. I‚Äôve watched his little brain grow so much in such a short time. HIGHLY recommend. If you don‚Äôt get the Lovevery I know there are plenty of less expensive alternatives but if you have the cash I say splurge. (I also may or may not have taken a 20 minute desperation nap on the floor with him playing next to me on the playmat) 

4. My  breastfeeding pillow: If you are planning to try and breastfeed get this pillow and take it with you to the hospital. Now that me and my son have become pros at latching we don‚Äôt use it as much but those first few weeks and especially the first few nights this was essential to our lives and my back/arms. It makes breastfeeding so much more comfortable and let‚Äôs you focus on baby instead of trying to hold him up. I have since become a fan of the laid back breast feeding position and have purchased a husband pillow for that (baby has a lot of reflux and that position has done wonders for helping him keep food down). I do still use the Brestfriend at times when I feel like he‚Äôs not draining certain areas of my breast and we need to switch positions. 

5. A good peri bottle: yes the hospital will give you one but it most likely will be a cheap barely useable on. As much as I needed this thing the first 3-4 weeks (baby boy ripped me a new one) it was worth the  [$10](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X1RW2SP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FJK02FTWVKXG4FA9RZCM?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to get a better quality one.

I did have a rough pregnancy. I was hospitalized a few times. A couple for dehydration because of really bad morning sickness, twice because my gallbladder decided to play up and once for a suspected umbilical hernia.

My doctor and I decided to induce me a week early so the Saturday afternoon of May 29th was go time. I had had my hospital bag packed for weeks, my husband was able to tell work it was time and I had my little boys outfit all set out. It went fairly typically for a while. The contractions got stronger but the epidural worked like a charm.

Until it didn't. I could feel the contractions again and felt the need to push but I was only 5cm dilated. It was too early buy I really wanted too. Then things changed...

5am of May 30th. 

I was losing blood. My son's heart rate jumped to over 200 beats per minute. All of a sudden we were an orange emergency and I was being wheeled into the operating room. Honestly, I don't remember too other than high. I didn't feel pain. I felt sick. I threw up quite a bit. I felt the tugging then all of a sudden a feeling of being light. 

My son didn't scream for a little while. I remember saying to my husband ""don't worry, he must be shocked"". Those were the longest minutes of my life. A code pink was called.

Just as it was called he screamed so loud it was a huge relief. He had skin to skin with my husband while they worked on me a little more. 

5:32am my little boy was born. 21 inches. 8lbs and 2 oz. He's a joy and I love him to bits.

But I did give birth to my son. Yes, it wasn't the way I'd hoped. It sure as hell wasn't planned. I'm just tired of seeing all over the internet the opinion of some that c-section mothers aren't mothers. 

We shouldn't be bashing each other down. We're mothers in this together. C-section or vaginally. First, last or rainbow; these are our babies and we will love them no matter what.

FTM 29 weeks today and I'm tired of my damn weight always being the main concern for my doctor. I had weigh loss surgery back in February 2020 and went from 416 to 256. I found out i was pregnant exactly a year after surgery and my weight was 256. My first trimester was horrible!! I couldn't keep anything down and lived off saltines, seltzer and protein shakes (when i could keep it down) so my weight went down to 240. During my second trimester i was finally able to eat more and went back to 256 and slowly got up to 260-264 depending on the time of day and how much damn liquid ive had. My doctor decided that that weight gain was too much and made it a point to let me know. Ok i understood maybe i gained too much too fast. Idk its my first successful pregnancy so far. So i start eating healthier but this baby loves his carbs!!!


Fast forward to my doctor sending me to a specialist to check the baby's heart because he wouldn't let us see anything in the ultrasound. I get told i have too much fluid and that it can cause early term labor. Specialist explained that it can be due to my diet or to my PCOS or a combination of both. So he puts me on a high protein, low fat, low carb diet. 

I see my doctor today and she never mentions the extra fluid or anything!! Just how great it is that i only gained 4 pounds this month. She doesn't mention the specialists results on my baby's heart until i ask her if everything was ok. (Thankfully everything was good)  Wtf is my weight more important than his heart???? 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm just tired of doctors always making my weight the main concern! Technically I've only gained 14lbs from my original weight. And after a lifetime of people talking about my weight I'm tired!

After a few minutes I was able to walk outside. I laid down on a bench and I felt a LOT better. Being away from the smells helped a lot, as did having my mask off. Afterwards I ate some cookies and drank lemonade and that helped a lot too. I was able to drive home and felt fine today. 

I called the ob office and they said because I didn't actually faint they don't need me to come in, but to call if it happened again. It kind of freaked me out how sudden it was, and the fact that I'm only 10 weeks. I thought I would be fine to shop like a normal person üò≠!!

I'm a 33F with past health issues that lowered my chances of conceiving. I went off birth control a year ago, in large part because my partner was about to leave for work for 7+ months and I'd be living alone during COVID. I decided to focus the solo time on getting back to my regular cycle and working on some lifestyle changes to manage my anxiety. Hormonal birth control always messed with my anxiety, and it was such a relief to remove that variable.

My partner returned in June and we're getting married in September. In this whirlwind of life events, we had lots of conversations about birth control and agreed that given my age + other health factors, it wasn't likely I'd get pregnant anytime soon. Still, ultimately we know we want to have children, so I wouldn't bother going back on birth control and messing with my hormones all over again. We figured if by some slim chance we did get pregnant this year, it'd just be a happy surprise.

Lo and behold, yesterday I had a positive pregnancy test. And I'm scared. Super selfishly, I'm worried I'll be sick at our wedding and on our honeymoon. With COVID, I'm wondering if we should even have a wedding or a honeymoon. Meanwhile, I'm crampy, bloated, not sleeping well, and my breasts hurt soo bad. I'm just not thinking clearly.

One thing I do know for sure is that I want to create a calm and nurturing environment for my baby. Yet I'm prone to anxiety and this surprise is way more overwhelming than happy right now. I *do* so want children - I've dreamed of this for as long as I can remember. It was my single greatest wish in life, and I couldn't have imagined a better partner to do this with. 

Yet... my dominant feeling right now is scared. Scared of feeling sick for 9+ months, of labor, of mood changes, and everything else. I find myself wondering if we were fools to go off birth control, or if we've cost ourselves a year or so of just being married without kids (as many parent friends have advised us to do).

Anyone else find themselves having an unexpected reaction to their pregnancy? I know it might just take a while to process, but I'd love to hear about anyone else's experience and welcome advice on how to get some perspective and take this day by day.

My SIL is my husband‚Äôs only sister‚Ä¶he has two step-brothers who are also married (to lovely ladies!). All of us have baby girls. I have 2 daughters and the other two women have 1, each. SIL is single/unmarried and not a parent. 

During the height of the pandemic, we didn‚Äôt see SIL frequently because she‚Äôs a huge partier and bar hopper. Now that things are better in our area, we‚Äôve seen her a few times at family gatherings. She‚Äôs been cordial to us, in person. On social media, however, she posts a lot of memes about spoiling and loving her nieces and only tags the other two ladies. She has done this probably 15 times. She has also posted a memory with all of her siblings and tagged all of them except for my husband. 

She didn‚Äôt buy our girls Christmas gifts or birthday gifts last year, but every time I see her, she alludes to gifts she gets the other nieces (matching dresses, shoes, etc) for no occasion at all.  She even was bragging to other family members how much she spoils her nieces and how she‚Äôs a great aunt at a bridal shower I went to‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt care about material items, it‚Äôs more the fact that she‚Äôs slighting my girls intentionally. It‚Äôs even more apparent when one of my nieces is the exact age of my younger daughter‚Ä¶she posted pictures at her birthday party and her pile of gifts,  when she completely ignored my youngest weeks before. 

It hurts my feelings (for my girls) and it makes my husband mad. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs even worth addressing though. My husband has brought up issues in the past (just between the two of them, not involving me or the kids) and it caused a major rub. We are currently TTC #3 and I don‚Äôt want to involve her in any aspect of that, which I made sure to do last time (she planned a gender reveal and helped with the sprinkle).

A little backstory:
Since July 18th I‚Äôve been having a weird pain/ pressure / something burning feeling on my left side where my ovaries are. I had a gyno appointment on July 20th and she didn‚Äôt see a cyst or anything but said the egg was about to be released (from the right side) and the pain is maybe from ovulation. I took a pregnancy test on the 31st and about 6 more since and they are all positive. 

My pain on the left side has not gone away since the 18th and I believe was there before conception. Being pregnant I am hyper aware of it. I saw my doctor yesterday and she estimates me at 4 weeks and also said my uterus may be tilted towards the left which is causing the pain. I had a blood test (waiting for results) and have a follow up next week. 

Of course I self diagnosed with Dr. Google who says it could be ectopic or cancer secreting HCG. The pain pressure feeling on my left side is consistently there but I feel it more when laying down. 

I keep trying to be positive and tell myself that its not cancer and I am actually pregnant and to stop freaking out when it could be nothing.

What should I do?

I‚Äôm about 7 weeks +5 days pregnant with my second child‚Ä¶and I am about 8.5 months post partum after having a healthy baby boy last November. The labor and delivery was tough on me, having had hemorrhaging and requiring 2 units of blood before I was discharged home. The first few weeks post partum I had went through severe anxiety and had uncontrollable crying. I know it was mostly due to hormones but I was also stressed because my body wasn‚Äôt able to produce milk for my baby, and so I had to resort to formula feeding. 

At my post partum check up my doc noticed my neck was swollen, and a week later I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The next couple of months were spent with me stressing about dying from cancer and never going to see my baby boy grow up or have more children. I Had surgery to remove the cancer and now I will need regular blood work check ups to monitor my thyroid function but otherwise I‚Äôm ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. 

My family and I finally have a routine going with caring for the baby and sleep training him and finally getting some sleep ourselves. and I‚Äôm back at work full time (night nurse). Things were finally settling down until I noticed my period was 2 weeks late. Low and behold I took a test and it was positive. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. The last 8 months have been so difficult and stressful, mentally and physically, that I don‚Äôt know if I can go through another pregnancy so soon. My husband is all for it because he thinks it‚Äôs great that the baby will have a close sibling in age to play and bond with. But my mom and I spend most of the week taking care of the baby and my husband is only able to physically care for the baby on the weekends because he works in another city far away. So I don‚Äôt think he truly understands how tired I am caring for our fussy and unruly 8.5 month old (who‚Äôs going through the 8 month regression), and having to work full time in a stressful job while going through the first trimester fatigue. We are also in the process of building a new home so we can eventually live together but that won‚Äôt be until March 2022, when the baby will arrive. 

I just feel like I should abort this baby because I don‚Äôt feel mentally and physically ready for it.

Yesterday I was super rude to a customer and although they absolutely deserved it, I am now left feeling somewhat gross, not like myself, and even a bit confused about how I responded to him. I can usually stay calm and then just complain about it after somebody leaves but I made a super snarky remark to him in front of my employees (of course it was only a reaction to HIS super snarky remark.) I have this sinking fear that it will somehow come back to bite me in the butt. I also am embarrassed at how I acted in front of my employees because I‚Äôd be pissed if they ever treated a customer like that. 

Additionally, a friend who has been treating me like absolute shit for a while even though she doesn‚Äôt see it that way, I completely told off and broke off our friendship. I wasn‚Äôt mean and I didn‚Äôt say anything that wouldn‚Äôt arguably benefit her to hear.

I'm just about over the shock as I was convinced it was a girl. 

Still, couldn't be happier. What a lovely surprise today.

Fun story - my GP is absolute shite. They are one of 2 in our city that bulk bill, so packed, hard to get appointments etc. I was supposed to be going away tomorrow for my 40th but not now due to a snap lockdown (thanks Dickhead Dan - cos 6 cases is a runaway for sure). Anyway - they said could only have an appointment tomorrow - long after we were meant to be on the road. I had another 2 results that I was meant to go and pick up so I could give to midwife next week..... I decided to try to be really sneaky and go get them from the receptionist. Today they are absolutely chockers as it's covid vaccine day in the clinic - so I thought I'd give it a go. 

I went in and told them I was there to pick up hard copies of results as per GP (not a lie)- to give to the midwife. Yes, technically the GP had said to get them, but I hadn't been given the Harmony results yet - as when I spoke to him yesterday they hadn't come in, just my 12 week ultrasound &amp; blood results for nuchal translucency (which he had told me about over the phone). 

As expected with how busy they were - i was able to get them to print them all off - including Harmony which hadn't been given to me by GP yet, take them home and get hubby to tell me what the gender was. Let's just call it a little bit of misdirection....... 

Do I feel guilty? No. The 12 week scan &amp; blood results matched all the Harmony results and I was able to find out the gender today - without taking up an appointment with a GP who is already overstretched. 

Please bear in mind - this came to pass after a number of stuff ups this week with the GP, including being on hold for 50 minutes to MAKE AN APPOINTMENT - only to be hung up on as I got to number 1 in the queue. I've honestly done them a favour.

My ex gf, we‚Äôll call her Kara, I loved and treated well, but she had a pattern of way over reacting and saying and doing very abusive things to me. She‚Äôs threatened to break up with me only to not mean it, she‚Äôs threatened abortion when she didn‚Äôt mean it, hit me before, she‚Äôs let my dog out, she‚Äôs put holes in my walls, and most recently she threatened to come to my work and cause a scene, kicked me out of our shared apartment, and then ran away and threatened to kill herself to the point I had to call the police, Kara was ok and came home the next day. During this fight I did unleash a long list of, somewhat exaggerated things I dislike about her and our relationship that I should have communicated about sooner, and certainly not in an already out of control fight, after I unleashed this list I watched her run away, I let her go (then she threatened to kill herself) she had no idea I felt certain ways and wish I had told her sooner, which I should have. It wasn‚Äôt all bad, I mean just days prior I expressed in a parenting class we take together on a homework page that if I could spend the day with anyone it would be her, when asked about my future plans for myself I expressed wanting to marry her, I mean I signed a lease with this woman, but when these horrible toxic fights occur, and there now is a pattern, I can‚Äôt do it (our last really bad one was about three months prior) 

After she came back, I then promptly and in not the most gentle of tone (I was harsh and mad) broke up with her at 14 weeks pregnant and asked her to leave our new shared apartment together. She now lives two hours away back home with her parents.

Kara was obviously devastated and has begged and pleaded to not close the chapter on us yet, but I told her there is too large of a pattern of these toxic outbursts from her, and that I can‚Äôt live my life where at any moment my life is in her hands and out of control, and that this situation and relationship was no longer healthy for me, for her, or for the baby, and that she needs help. I refuse to discuss our romantic relationship with Kara but told her I wanted to be a part of this child‚Äôs life.

Kara says she knows she has to get better because if she doesn‚Äôt we all know we won‚Äôt have a choice and will have to do adoption. She‚Äôs shown a lot of remorse and commitment to wanting to get the help she needs through therapy and with a psychiatrist. She‚Äôs also upset that I broke up with her when just days prior I expressed I wanted to marry her (which I meant), she no longer is living in our shared apartment and is at home two hours away from me, and she‚Äôs 14 weeks pregnant and please don‚Äôt do this she needs me now more than ever, it sounds like she understands I am not a professional and she needs real help and she is seeking it with her parents helping her through all of this, she‚Äôs not even necessarily asking to not take space or to get back together in the next few weeks, she just wishes I‚Äôd talk to her about us more but I refuse to do so.  As a result, she thinks I‚Äôve done what‚Äôs best for me, not what‚Äôs best for her and baby, and that she‚Äôll have to do this pregnancy alone, and that even if I do come to some appointments or call once a week, doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt doing this pregnancy alone and that she‚Äôll be the one laying in bed by herself with a big pregnant belly, she‚Äôs reminded me what about in sickness or in health for better or for worse that she is so sorry and getting help she just wants to keep an open mind to the future of us and discuss it a bit more, she also mentioned how is she supposed to focus on fixing her mental health problems, heal from a breakup, and be pregnant, that this is clearly what‚Äôs best for me and not her and baby, but I disagree, this is what‚Äôs best for all of us.

Now, she won‚Äôt talk to me at all. I want to go these appointments, I want to give her a courtesy call once a week, I want to eventually discuss co parenting plans, but she won‚Äôt answer my texts.

So a couple of weeks ago I had the worst cramps of my life, I was diagnosed with a UTI and given antibiotics which seemed to clear it up but a couple of nights ago it came back so last night I went to an out of hours service just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt ectopic. I think I‚Äôm around 6 weeks, the doctor said he thinks the UTI is back but sends me to get an internal ultrasound just in case.

While getting the ultrasound the doctor starts asking me about my periods and what they‚Äôre like, I tell her they used to be awful when i was growing up (I‚Äôd bleed through tampons and pads within an hour, it was terrible but my mum didn‚Äôt want me on birth control because she didn‚Äôt want people to think I was having sex despite me begging her) when I moved out I went on the pill for about 9 years and everything was all good. I came off it in September 2020 and although my periods were still heavy they weren‚Äôt as bad as before. She informs me I have endometriosis and also a big cyst on my right ovary. She said I‚Äôve been managing it the way they would by going on the combined pill and not to worry too much about it. 
I see the little baby, a little yoke sac and a tiny heartbeat, all in the right place which is great!
She then says I have an abnormal shaped uterus, not necessarily bad but there‚Äôs almost a dark line down the middle. She is referring me to an early pregnancy unit for another scan.
I then stupidly went on google and saw uterine septum‚Äôs which I‚Äôm now terrified is what I have.

Basically has anyone dealt with any of this and had a healthy pregnancy? Does anyone else have a weird shaped uterus?

Well id say its neutral.. the results from the ultrasound showed that, she is head down which is good, her head and stomach have grown normal size for how far along i am, but they did say that her arms and legs are measuring slightly shorter than what they should be, she didnt sound concerned about that because she said they‚Äôre still growing so there is time for that to change, and hearing that news doesn‚Äôt necessarily concern me because all the women on my side of the family are small and petite, and on her father‚Äôs side, the women are also very short too. (Staying positive)

The concerning thing to us all was that ‚Äúher weight is just slightly above the underweight threshold by a pound and a half‚Äù thats a specific quote from the lady who gives the ultrasounds (idk the terms for these people sorry) 

So because of all this, they will be closely monitoring me until birth, and on my next visit in 2 weeks i most likely will have another ultrasound. They did tell me to expect a smaller baby than average at birth.

I know a lot of you said Fundal Height measurements are inaccurate a lot, and  yes ive seen that by a few weeks on a lot of my past appointments but it still bothers me that she said it was 11 weeks instead of about 2 or 3 behind and i still never got an explanation from the doctor or anything about that but i have calmed down a lot since i saw the baby on the ultrasound, so I‚Äôm keeping my head up.

Measured 5.5 lbs (16th percentile) at 36 weeks, was born 6 lbs at 39+5. Ate 6+ dates and 1-3 cups red raspberry leaf tea from weeks 32+ and bounced on birthing ball daily from week 28+. Induction scheduled for due date due to low Papp-A.

Labor TLDR: 30 hours of laboring at home til 5 cm, 15 hour labor and delivery in the hospital unmedicated until 8 cm, water broken near 10 cm, 2.5 hours pushing, 1 small internal tear. No laboring in bed until epidural nap at 8cm, delivery in bed on back. 

TW? experience overall was positive, but i definitely feel traumatized at some of the stuff i experienced and i mention negative thoughts that i had during the labor and delivery. 

LONG AF story below: 

Woke up at 3 am on Monday (39+3) with painful contractions.The contractions stayed consistently 5 min apart for almost 24 hours so i was convinced it was prodromal ('false') labor that wasn't progressing me any. Got 4 hours of sleep Monday night due to the contractions. Spent the rest of the night swaying in the kitchen during contractions because sitting/lying made the contractions much more painful. Spoiler, this was the opposite of what i expected for labor and actually influenced the interventions/length of my labor a lot. (Is it common to have much more painful contractions while lying/sitting?!) 

Around the 28 hour mark, my contractions begin coming at a 3 minute frequency after i took a bath. I could no longer practice my breathing during them and had to moan through them. I had diarrhea (1st time during pregnancy) and lost my mucus plug.  Called my husband and we did the 1 hour drive to the hospital, where it took 2 hours waiting in triage. I was convinced it could still be false labor so i was surprised when they said i was 5 cm. I was 1.5 cm a few days prior at my appointment. Got admitted and spent the first 6 hours bouncing on the birth ball, walking the halls, and swaying. I was GBS positive so i had my IV meds every 4 hours but my nurse let me disconnect to walk the halls, and she brought me hummus and pretzels and diced fruit despite not having official permission to let me eat solid food. I was grateful for this because i hadn't eaten since 9 am (mashed potatoes and a whole pineapple). After 6 hours i had progressed to 7.5 cm, which was just a 2.5 cm increase. The next 2 hours, my pain ramped up, and my legs were getting tired because i was spending all my time standing due to how much less painful it was than sitting. I was starting to get shakey and hoped it was transition rather than just exhaustion. I was trying to pee often to keep my bladder empty and lessen the contraction pain but i started to have difficulty emptying it. At this point i was squeezing my husbands fingers each contraction and moaning through my breathing. Nurses said i was a superstar for being so calm and put together. They checked me 2 hours later and i had only progressed to 8 cm, which was .5 cm more.  My body was starting to push during contractions due to strong urges to do so. I tried so hard not to, because i wasn't 10 cm and the nurses kept saying i could rip my cervix, but i couldnt control my body. I was feeling defeated, especially after i found out i couldn't get IV meds for the pain because 8 cm was too far along. I wanted to sit or lie down to let my body rest, hoping it would progress labor faster without the added stress of me standing on my feet where my legs were having trouble holding up my extra 40 lbs of pregnancy weight. I asked for the epidural after i started crying from the hip and back pain that had started to accompany the contractions. Thankfully i only had to wait 30 minutes for the anesthesiologist, who was done in 5 minutes. I instantly felt better and slept for an hour before i was woken up by nurses, who checked me and said we should start pushing because i was 10 cm. I had the idea that pushing would be easier than the earlier stages of labor, so i eagerly agreed despite being so tired (lol regrets). 

With the epidural i couldn't feel any urges to push or contractions, so the nurse told me when to push. I was told to hold my breath for 10 seconds and push, 3 x per contraction. This was against my birthing wishes; i wanted to NOT hold my breath and use diaphragmatic breathing to push when my body naturally pushed (like what was happening at 8 cm before the epidural). However, i was tired and decided to do it as long as it progressed the labor. In between contractions i would focus on diaphragmatic breathing, which i think MAY have helped me shorten the pushing period to just 2.5 hours, but i also think it made me more tired because i wasn't really resting between the contractions. I started to get shakey again and was confused because i thought that was something that only happened during transition, not the pushing stage after 10 cm. I have health anxiety and thought i might have an undetected infection, but my nurse just kept saying it's normal and there's nothing to do about it. It was so hard to push when i wasn't feeling any natural impulses to do so and when my whole body was shivering like crazy. I also got nauseous but they quickly put anti nausea meds in my IV. All i could think about was telling my nurse i needed a break, but i felt like if i stopped i would just give up on delivering and had no idea how much i would have to argue for a C-section. Around the 1.5 hour mark, i started getting a lot of pressure in my butt. The pressure was really uncomfortable and i couldn't tell if it was pain or pressure so my nurse offered more epidural but i was afraid i wouldn't be able to push as effectively. I felt like i had hours left because baby was still behind my pelvic bone. I kept pushing like crazy because i felt like nothing was happening even though there was so much pressure. I was surprised when my nurse said the baby was crowning and that she would be out shortly. The midwife came in to catch the baby, along with like 5 other nurses and I had no idea how to deliver the baby because it felt like my vagina would literally not let the head out. I was convinced i would have worse than a 4th degree tear. I was telling my nurse that i couldn't do it and that i just wanted them to pull the baby out, use a vacuum or whatever. She just kept encouraging me and i didn't believe her but i kept pushing and i thought i might pass out. I was too disoriented to even notice the ring of fire, all i was focused on was getting the WHOLE baby out of me. For some reason when her head was out i thought it was her whole body, so when they said i had 1 more push, i screamed as loud as i could because i felt i was in literal hell and I just couldn't imagine it ending. When she came out i started crying out of nowhere due to the relief and my husband was right there crying too. The midwife was shocked i could feel her do the examination for tearing and added more epidural but it didn't kick in (maybe because redheads need more anesthesia?) so she did local anesthesia which honestly didn't kick in all the way either but i felt fine distracted by my baby and was also in shock that i only had 1 small internal tear.

After unexpectedly finding out that my partner and I are expecting a baby back in June, we have been trying to keep things fairly private and wanted to take everything at our pace. We told my partner‚Äôs families fairly early on, mostly because we couldn‚Äôt contain our excitement and knew (or so we thought) that they could keep a secret.

After a long history of losses, I wanted to make sure that baby was healthy before making any kind of public announcement. At the time that I found out I was pregnant, I was uninsured so I couldn‚Äôt afford an ultrasound out of pocket. I finally got back onto an insurance plan and can‚Äôt be seen until I‚Äôm roughly 14 weeks. A little late in the game, I know, but what can ya do? 

Anyways, rewind to a few days ago when my mil takes it upon herself to plaster the news of our pregnancy on Facebook. Keep in mind, we haven‚Äôt had an ultrasound yet and therefore don‚Äôt even have a due date. She comes up with some random date and decides that‚Äôs good and posts it.

Hell, she could have asked PERMISSION first. For whatever reason, permission flew completely over her head.

We hadn‚Äôt even had the opportunity to announce it ourselves, which was something my partner was very excited to do as he‚Äôs been absolutely over the moon since finding out.

First pregnancy, baby was up, until I get to fully dilate it would Take some time. Thats why I wansnt really √Æn a hurry, until I called the ambulance.

When the ambulance was on the way my water broke, released for a second until hell broke, after my water broke the contractions started to be bad, really bad. Finally ambulance arrived and I was screaming at the top of my lungs, felt the need to push, was flushed with fluids, it hurt like hell and I was dreading on the ideea I would poop √Æn the ambulance. √én 10 minutes tops we were getting inside the hospital, still screaming, with people asking me questions and all of them telling me not to scream because it will make me tired and leave me without air. Its true, but how can you restrian yourself when it hurts?! One Quick check up to realise I was fully dilated,all of these within a couple of hours. I finally got on the table and I dont think I needed more than 6-7 pushes and the help of the doctor to feel her out. Oh the feeling of release was amazing, finally out. Didnt know what hit me when I saw my kid on my chest.

I know its hard and difficult, I was maybe one of the happy cases √Æn which every thing was finished within a couple of hours, and I really was. Until I could realise what happened everything was finished.

It took a lot for me to not bite his head off. Im also peeing all the time, having Braxton Hicks and it‚Äôs getting hard to move around and all that jazz. Sometimes, im out of breath just by the way im sitting.

I get home this evening, prepare dinner in the slow cooker for tomorrow and get a bit flustered I suppose. SO is on the couch after coming back from the bar and watching videos on his phone. Whatever, but im a little irritated and don‚Äôt really know why. We also have a kitten that‚Äôs needy and hyper. On top of things, im having trouble deciding what to have for dinner because I know im hungry. I make a shitty quesadilla, eat it in the kitchen , then go into the living room. I sit on another couch not with SO.

He asks me why im not sitting with him and I just shrug and turn my attention towards kitty. Then my phone. After some time, SO gets the laser pointer and points it at my foot. The kitten claws at my toe and it fucking hurts. I get pissed and SoO says ‚Äúlol it‚Äôs a little funny‚Äù im not amused and he had the full to ask me why im so miserable. I say fuck it im going to bed. Im tired. He says whatever.

26w5d

We decided early on that we wanted to pay for the venue and food for our baby shower. We have a large amount of immediate family members, extended family, and close friends. We made a list of about 65 people and genuinely wanted everyone there. We didn‚Äôt want to put the financial burden on anyone nor did we want to exclude anyone. 

Thankfully, I have a good amount of female friends who have volunteered to help my husband with decorations, invitations, setup/clean, and research. 

It might all sound weird but this is our first child, we‚Äôve been married 10 years, and are more or less financially better off at the moment due to the no kids for 10 years lol 

How much do people normally spend on catered food and a venue?

We‚Äôre looking at a place Friday thats $300, has access to a bar and lets you bring outside food. Seems reasonable.

Back story: At 5 weeks pregnant I had some spotting but it was extremely light and lasted less than 24 hours. I thought I'd check with my OB just in case. 1st time I call, they were about to close and wouldn't let me talk to the nurse. The receptionist acted as a go between and told me if I was having bleeding go to the ER. I wasn't bleeding at that time anymore so I figured I'd call back the next day when I could actually talk to the nurse. Next day, talk to the nurse, they say they will call me back, and then call and say the doctor needs to see me.

I go in, doctor acts all doom and gloom like I'm screwed because I didn't go to the ER immediately all because I have Rh negative blood (which I am fully aware of). We do an ultrasound and the sac is in the uterus so no worry of extopic. Said maybe there was a hematoma. They send me for bloodwork and say ""come back in an hour for your Rhogam"". I come back. It's not ready. Come back in 4 hours. I come back. Get my shot, and the doctor says ""light duty, no sex, etc"" until your check up in 2-3 weeks.

Here I am 3 weeks later. I walk in and NO ONE knows why I'm there. I had a nurse ask me ""are you even pregnant?"". I was rushed around to 3 different rooms because they were scrambling to get the ultrasound machine since they had no idea that's what I was there for. Finally got to confirm a heartbeat (yay!) and was promptly told ""BYE!"".

I walked out realizing I wasn't given the go ahead for sex, or to work out, or go back to work at full capacity or anything about the hematoma. No guidance on that whatsoever. I sort of blame myself but I was more concerned about just making sure I still had a baby cooking.

I was so upset I called the only other OB office in the area that I used to go to (I followed the OB I like to my current place). There are 2 doctors there. One told me during my first pregnancy I should be induced at 37 weeks because I was already 3cm dilated. The other doctor is just old with no bedside manners but she delivered my first baby so I can tolerate her. Well she's having knee surgery so she'll be gone the rest of 2021. I'll eventually have to switch to that office because mine doesn't do deliveries but I can't switch now when the only option is the one doctor I dislike the most.

I'm just frustrated. Tired. Emotional. I want to work out, have sex, and know that nothing bad will happen if I run after my toddler. I haven't bled at all since 5 weeks so it seems good but I just wanted actual medical advice on it.",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,91946,public,self,Crappy Medical Care,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/oy5wrd/crappy_medical_care/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I went to the hospital due to severe abdominal pressure and they did a vaginal sonogram and couldn‚Äôt find the sac because it was too early to find one. (I was 4 weeks.) They told me to see the OB I saw for my first pregnancy. 
My OB will NOT give me a sonogram. I‚Äôve been once to get my HCG levels tested and they came back and so I asked for a sonogram and they still will not give me one. They want to do an HCG test every week for the next few weeks before any imagery is done. 
(With my first pregnancy, I was 5 weeks along and they took my blood and gave me sonogram/imagery thing that same day.)

I also had an interview at my work for a great promotion that I really want.

This morning, I wee'd on my stick, got my BFP, and a call with the job offer I really want in a male dominated team.

This is my second pregnancy, I lost my first at 5 weeks 5 days and I was so devastated, so I know I'm not out of the woods but I'm feeling excited and anxious all at the same time about pregnancy, loss, becoming a mum, career confusion, what will people thing etc.....

I'm hoping I can hide my pregnancy until 20 weeks but I may have only been in the job two months by then and I'm afraid I'll look like I should have said something before they hired me, but I know that's ridiculous.

I don't really know what I want from posting about this. Can someone tell me everything will be ok?!",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,91937,public,self,Landed a great promotion the same day I got my BFP...

For context, I broke up with my ""best-Friend"" last year after struggling to keep our friendship due to covid views and the fact that I was engaged and no longer ""prioritized"" her.  I was experiencing a lot of stuff at the time, between being furloughed, then going back as an ""essential worker"", choosing to go back to school full time while working full time with lots of work drama - needless to say I was overwhelmed. My SO has been my rock through out. But my friendship deteriorated completely, and since she was the connection to my other couple friends it seems they also disconnected completely.  

Anyways, I got married in a small outdoor ceremony earlier this year and am now 17 weeks pregnant. My sister-in-law started asking me who is going to throw me a baby-shower. I honestly felt so awkward. I have two friends unrelated to the previous ""best friend"" circle. But although I've grown a bit closer to them, I don't feel comfortable asking them to throw me anything. 

I've made a registry to get the discounts but I don't care about throwing any baby showers or festivities. I'm totally okay with just having my baby and celebrating with my husband. It's just very awkward to get asked about it. 

Anyways, I just wanted to know, Are there any other FTM here who are not having a baby shower? Is it weird not to have one?",True,False,False,pregnant,t5_2qwzb,91937,public,self,FTM Babyshower?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/oy4c7p/ftm_babyshower/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,
